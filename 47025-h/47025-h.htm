<p class="first">The first edition of this work was published in 1854,
and, although a large one, has been long out of print. Many inquiries
having been made for it since the recent lamented death of the
translator, the publishers have determined to offer a second edition to
the public, and have been advised to give it a place in their
&ldquo;English and Foreign Philosophical Library.&rdquo; It is an exact
reprint of the first edition, and they trust it will be received with
equal favour.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The clamour excited by the present work has not
surprised me, and hence it has not in the least moved me from my
position. On the contrary, I have once more, in all calmness, subjected
my work to the severest scrutiny, both historical and philosophical; I
have, as far as possible, freed it from its defects of form, and
enriched it with new developments, illustrations, and historical
testimonies,&mdash;testimonies in the highest degree striking and
irrefragable. Now that I have thus verified my analysis by historical
proofs, it is to be hoped that readers whose eyes are not sealed will
be convinced and will admit, even though reluctantly, that my work
contains a faithful, correct translation of the Christian religion out
of the Oriental language of imagery into plain speech. And it has no
pretension to be anything more than a close translation, or, to speak
literally, an empirical or historico-philosophical analysis, a solution
of the enigma of the Christian religion. The general propositions which
I premise in the Introduction are no <i>&agrave; priori</i>,
excogitated propositions, no products of speculation; they have arisen
out of the analysis of religion; they are only, as indeed are all the
fundamental ideas of the work, generalisations from the known
manifestations of human nature, and in particular of the religious
consciousness,&mdash;facts converted into thoughts, <i>i.e.</i>,
expressed in general terms, and thus made the property of the
understanding. The ideas of my work are only conclusions,
<i>consequences</i>, drawn from premisses which are not themselves mere
ideas, but objective facts either actual or historical&mdash;facts
which had not their place <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e233" href=
"#xd21e233" name="xd21e233">viii</a>]</span>in my head simply in virtue
of their ponderous existence in folio. I unconditionally repudiate
<i>absolute</i>, immaterial, self-sufficing speculation&mdash;that
speculation which draws its material from within. I differ <i>toto
c&oelig;lo</i> from those philosophers who pluck out their eyes that
they may see better; for <i>my</i> thought I require the senses,
especially sight; I found my ideas on materials which can be
appropriated only through the activity of the senses. I do not generate
the object from the thought, but the thought from the object; and I
hold <i>that</i> alone to be an object which has an existence beyond
one&rsquo;s own brain. I am an idealist only in the region of
<i>practical</i> philosophy, that is, I do not regard the limits of the
past and present as the limits of humanity, of the future; on the
contrary, I firmly believe that many things&mdash;yes, many
things&mdash;which with the short-sighted, pusillanimous practical men
of to-day, pass for flights of imagination, for ideas never to be
realised, for mere chimeras, will to-morrow, <i>i.e.</i>, in the next
century,&mdash;centuries in individual life are days in the life of
humanity,&mdash;exist in full reality. Briefly, the &ldquo;Idea&rdquo;
is to me only faith in the historical future, in the triumph of truth
and virtue; it has for me only a political and moral significance; for
in the sphere of strictly theoretical philosophy, I attach myself, in
direct opposition to the Hegelian philosophy, only to <i>realism</i>,
to materialism in the sense above indicated. The maxim hitherto adopted
by speculative philosophy: All that is mine I carry with me, the old
<i>omnia mea mecum porto</i>, I cannot, alas! appropriate. I have many
things outside myself, which I cannot convey either in my pocket or my
head, but which nevertheless I look upon as belonging to me, not indeed
as a mere man&mdash;a view not now in question&mdash;but as a
philosopher. I am nothing but a <i>natural philosopher in the domain of
mind</i>; and the natural philosopher can do nothing without
instruments, without material means. In this character I have written
the present work, which consequently contains nothing else than the
principle of a new philosophy verified practically, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i lang="la">in concreto</i>, in application to a special object, but
an object which has a universal significance: namely, to religion, in
which this principle is exhibited, developed, and thoroughly carried
out. This philosophy is essentially distinguished from the systems
hitherto prevalent, in that it corresponds to the real, complete
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e270" href="#xd21e270" name=
"xd21e270">ix</a>]</span>nature of man; but for that very reason it is
antagonistic to minds perverted and crippled by a superhuman,
<i>i.e.</i>, anti-human, anti-natural religion and speculation. It does
not, as I have already said elsewhere, regard the <i>pen</i> as the
only fit organ for the revelation of truth, but the eye and ear, the
hand and foot; it does not identify the <i>idea</i> of the fact with
the fact itself, so as to reduce real existence to an existence on
paper, but it separates the two, and precisely by this separation
attains to the <i>fact itself</i>; it recognises as the true thing, not
the thing as it is an object of the abstract reason, but as it is an
object of the real, complete man, and hence as it is itself a real,
complete thing. This philosophy does not rest on an Understanding
<i>per se</i>, on an absolute, nameless understanding, belonging one
knows not to whom, but on the understanding of man;&mdash;though not, I
grant, on that of man enervated by speculation and dogma;&mdash;and it
speaks the language of men, not an empty, unknown tongue. Yes, both in
substance and in speech, it places philosophy in <i>the negation of
philosophy</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, it declares <i>that</i> alone to be the
true philosophy which is converted <i>in succum et sanguinem</i>, which
is incarnate in Man; and hence it finds its highest triumph in the fact
that to all dull and pedantic minds, which place the <i>essence</i> of
philosophy in the <i>show</i> of philosophy, it appears to be no
philosophy at all.</p>
<p>This philosophy has for its principle, not the Substance of Spinoza,
not the <i>ego</i> of Kant and Fichte, not the Absolute Identity of
Schelling, not the Absolute Mind of Hegel, in short, no abstract,
merely conceptional being, but a <i>real</i> being, the true <i>Ens
realissimum</i>&mdash;man; its principle, therefore, is in the highest
degree positive and real. It generates thought from the <i>opposite</i>
of thought, from Matter, from existence, from the senses; it has
relation to its object first through the senses, <i>i.e.</i>,
passively, before defining it in thought. Hence my work, as a specimen
of this philosophy, so far from being a production to be placed in the
category of Speculation,&mdash;although in another point of view it is
the true, the incarnate result of prior philosophical systems,&mdash;is
the direct opposite of speculation, nay, puts an end to it by
explaining it. Speculation makes religion say only what it has
<i>itself</i> thought, and expressed far better than religion; it
assigns a meaning to religion without any reference to the
<i>actual</i> meaning of religion; it does not look beyond <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e331" href="#xd21e331" name=
"xd21e331">x</a>]</span>itself. I, on the contrary, let religion itself
speak; I constitute myself only its listener and interpreter, not its
prompter. Not to invent, but to discover, &ldquo;to unveil
existence,&rdquo; has been my sole object; to <i>see</i> correctly, my
sole endeavour. It is not I, but religion that worships man, although
religion, or rather theology, denies this; it is not I, an
insignificant individual, but religion itself that says: God is man,
man is God; it is not I, but religion that denies the God who is
<i>not</i> man, but only an <i>ens rationis</i>,&mdash;since it makes
God become man, and then constitutes this God, not distinguished from
man, having a human form, human feelings, and human thoughts, the
object of its worship and veneration. I have only found the key to the
cipher of the Christian religion, only extricated its true meaning from
the web of contradictions and delusions called theology;&mdash;but in
doing so I have certainly committed a sacrilege. If therefore my work
is negative, irreligious, atheistic, let it be remembered that
atheism&mdash;at least in the sense of this work&mdash;is the secret of
religion itself; that religion itself, not indeed on the surface, but
fundamentally, not in intention or according to its own supposition,
but in its heart, in its essence, believes in nothing else than the
truth and divinity of human nature. Or let it be <i>proved</i> that the
historical as well as the rational arguments of my work are false; let
them be refuted&mdash;not, however, I entreat, by judicial
denunciations, or theological jeremiads, by the trite phrases of
speculation, or other pitiful expedients for which I have no name, but
by <i>reasons</i>, and such reasons as I have not already thoroughly
answered.</p>
<p>Certainly, my work is negative, destructive; but, be it observed,
only in relation to the <i>un</i>human, not to the human elements of
religion. It is therefore divided into two parts, of which the first
is, as to its main idea, <i>positive</i>, the second, including the
Appendix, not wholly, but in the main, <i>negative</i>; in both,
however, the same positions are proved, only in a different or rather
opposite manner. The first exhibits religion in its <i>essence</i>, its
<i>truth</i>, the second exhibits it in its <i>contradictions</i>; the
first is development, the second polemic; thus the one is, according to
the nature of the case, calmer, the other more vehement. Development
advances gently, contest impetuously; for development is self-contented
at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e370" href="#xd21e370" name=
"xd21e370">xi</a>]</span>every stage, contest only at the last blow.
Development is deliberate, but contest resolute. Development is
<i>light</i>, contest <i>fire</i>. Hence results a difference between
the two parts even as to their form. Thus in the first part I show that
the true sense of Theology is Anthropology, that there is no
distinction between the <i>predicates</i> of the divine and human
nature, and, consequently, no distinction between the divine and human
<i>subject</i>: I say <i>consequently</i>, for wherever, as is
especially the case in theology, the predicates are not accidents, but
express the essence of the subject, there is no distinction between
subject and predicate, the one can be put in the place of the other; on
which point I refer the reader to the Analytics of Aristotle, or even
merely to the Introduction of Porphyry. In the second part, on the
other hand, I show that the distinction which is made, or rather
supposed to be made, between the theological and anthropological
predicates resolves itself into an absurdity. Here is a striking
example. In the first part I prove that the Son of God is <i>in
religion</i> a real son, the son of God in the same sense in which man
is the son of man, and I find therein the <i>truth</i>, the
<i>essence</i> of religion, that it conceives and affirms a profoundly
human relation as a divine relation; on the other hand, in the second
part I show that the Son of God&mdash;not indeed in religion, but in
theology, which is the reflection of religion upon itself,&mdash;is not
a son in the natural, human sense, but in an entirely different manner,
contradictory to Nature and reason, and therefore absurd, and I find in
this negation of human sense and the human understanding, the negation
of religion. Accordingly the first part is the <i>direct</i>, the
second the <i>indirect</i> proof, that theology is anthropology: hence
the second part necessarily has reference to the first; it has no
independent significance; its only aim is to show that the sense in
which religion is interpreted in the previous part of the work
<i>must</i> be the true one, because the contrary is absurd. In brief,
in the first part I am chiefly concerned with <i>religion</i>, in the
second with <i>theology</i>: I say <i>chiefly</i>, for it was
impossible to exclude theology from the first part, or religion from
the second. A mere glance will show that my investigation includes
<i>speculative</i> theology or philosophy, and not, as has been here
and there erroneously supposed, <i>common</i> theology only, a kind of
trash from which I rather keep as clear <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e423" href="#xd21e423" name="xd21e423">xii</a>]</span>as possible,
(though, for the rest, I am sufficiently well acquainted with it),
confining myself always to the most essential, strict and necessary
definition of the object,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e425src" href=
"#xd21e425" name="xd21e425src">2</a> and hence to that definition which
gives to an object the most general interest, and raises it above the
sphere of theology. But it is with theology that I have to do, not with
theologians; for I can only undertake to characterise what is
<i>primary</i>,&mdash;the <i>original</i>, not the copy,
<i>principles</i>, not persons, <i>species</i>, not individuals,
<i>objects of history</i>, not objects of the <i lang="fr">chronique
scandaleuse</i>.</p>
<p>If my work contained only the second part, it would be perfectly
just to accuse it of a negative tendency, to represent the proposition:
Religion is nothing, is an absurdity, as its essential purport. But I
by no means say (that were an easy task!): God is nothing, the Trinity
is nothing, the Word of God is nothing, &amp;c. I only show that they
are not <i>that</i> which the illusions of theology make
them,&mdash;not foreign, but native mysteries, the mysteries of human
nature; I show that religion takes the apparent, the superficial in
Nature and humanity for the essential, and hence conceives their true
essence as a separate, special existence: that consequently, religion,
in the definitions which it gives of God, <i>e.g.</i>, of the Word of
God,&mdash;at least in those definitions which are not negative in the
sense above alluded to,&mdash;only defines or makes objective the true
nature of the human word. The reproach that according to my book
religion is an absurdity, a nullity, a pure illusion, would be well
founded only if, according to it, that into which I resolve religion,
which I prove to be its true object and substance, namely,
<i>man</i>,&mdash;<i>anthropology</i>, were an absurdity, a nullity, a
pure illusion. But so far from giving a trivial or even a subordinate
significance to anthropology,&mdash;a significance which is assigned to
it only just so long as a theology stands above it and in opposition to
it,&mdash;I, on the contrary, while reducing theology to anthropology,
exalt anthropology into theology, very much as Christianity, while
lowering God into man, made man into God; though, it is true, this
human God was by a further process made a transcendental, imaginary
God, remote from man. Hence it is obvious that I do not take the word
anthropology in the sense of the Hegelian or of any <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e461" href="#xd21e461" name=
"xd21e461">xiii</a>]</span>other philosophy, but in an infinitely
higher and more general sense.</p>
<p>Religion is the dream of the human mind. But even in dreams we do
not find ourselves in emptiness or in heaven, but on earth, in the
realm of reality; we only see real things in the entrancing splendour
of imagination and caprice, instead of in the simple daylight of
reality and necessity. Hence I do nothing more to religion&mdash;and to
speculative philosophy and theology also&mdash;than to open its eyes,
or rather to turn its gaze from the internal towards the external,
<i>i.e.</i>, I change the object as it is in the imagination into the
object as it is in reality.</p>
<p>But certainly for the present age, which prefers the sign to the
thing signified, the copy to the original, fancy to reality, the
appearance to the essence, this change, inasmuch as it does away with
illusion, is an absolute annihilation, or at least a reckless
profanation; for in these days <i>illusion</i> only is <i>sacred, truth
profane</i>. Nay, sacredness is held to be enhanced in proportion as
truth decreases and illusion increases, so that the highest degree of
illusion comes to be the highest degree of sacredness. Religion has
disappeared, and for it has been substituted, even among Protestants,
the <i>appearance</i> of religion&mdash;the Church&mdash;in order at
least that &ldquo;the faith&rdquo; may be imparted to the ignorant and
indiscriminating multitude; <i>that</i> faith being still the
Christian, because the Christian churches stand now as they did a
thousand years ago, and now, as formerly, the <i>external signs</i> of
the faith are in vogue. That which has no longer any existence in faith
(the faith of the modern world is only an ostensible faith, a faith
which does not believe what it fancies that it believes, and is only an
undecided, pusillanimous unbelief) is still to pass current as
<i>opinion</i>: that which is no longer sacred in itself and in truth
is still at least to <i>seem</i> sacred. Hence the simulated religious
indignation of the present age, the age of shows and illusion,
concerning my analysis, especially of the Sacraments. But let it not be
demanded of an author who proposes to himself as his goal not the
favour of his contemporaries, but only the truth, the unveiled, naked
truth, that he should have or feign respect towards an empty
appearance, especially as the object which underlies this appearance is
in itself the culminating point of religion, <i>i.e.</i>, the point at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e495" href="#xd21e495" name=
"xd21e495">xiv</a>]</span>which the religious slides into the
irreligious. Thus much in justification, not in excuse, of my analysis
of the Sacraments.</p>
<p>With regard to the true bearing of my analysis of the Sacraments,
especially as presented in the concluding chapter, I only remark, that
I therein illustrate by a palpable and visible example the essential
purport, the peculiar theme of my work; that I therein call upon the
senses themselves to witness to the truth of my analysis and my ideas,
and demonstrate <i lang="la">ad oculos, ad tactum, ad gustum</i>, what
I have taught <i lang="la">ad captum</i> throughout the previous pages.
As, namely, the water of Baptism, the wine and bread of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, taken in their natural power and significance, are
and effect infinitely more than in a supernaturalistic, illusory
significance; so the object of religion in general, conceived in the
sense of this work, <i>i.e.</i>, the anthropological sense, is
infinitely more productive and real, both in theory and practice, than
when accepted in the sense of theology. For as that which is or is
supposed to be imparted in the water, bread, and wine, over and above
these natural substances themselves, is something in the imagination
only, but in truth, in reality, nothing; so also the object of religion
in general, the Divine essence, in distinction from the essence of
Nature and Humanity,&mdash;that is to say, if its attributes, as
understanding, love, &amp;c., are and signify something else than these
attributes as they belong to man and Nature,&mdash;is only something in
the imagination, but in truth and reality nothing. Therefore&mdash;this
is the moral of the fable&mdash;we should not, as is the case in
theology and speculative philosophy, make real beings and things into
arbitrary signs, vehicles, symbols, or predicates of a distinct,
<span class="corr" id="xd21e508" title=
"Source: transcendant">transcendent</span>, absolute, <i>i.e.</i>,
abstract being; but we should accept and understand them in the
significance which they have in themselves, which is identical with
their qualities, with those conditions which make them what they
are:&mdash;thus only do we obtain the key to a <i>real theory and
practice</i>. I, in fact, put in the place of the barren baptismal
water, the beneficent effect of real water. How &ldquo;watery,&rdquo;
how trivial! Yes, indeed, very trivial. But so Marriage, in its time,
was a <i>very trivial truth</i>, which Luther, on the ground of his
natural good sense, maintained in opposition to the seemingly holy
illusion of celibacy. But while I thus view <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e521" href="#xd21e521" name=
"xd21e521">xv</a>]</span>water as a real thing, I at the same time
intend it as a vehicle, an image, an example, a symbol, of the
&ldquo;unholy&rdquo; spirit of my work, just as the water of
Baptism&mdash;the object of my analysis&mdash;is at once literal and
symbolical water. It is the same with bread and wine. Malignity has
hence drawn the conclusion that bathing, eating, and drinking are the
<i>summa summarum</i>, the positive result of my work. I make no other
reply than this: If the whole of religion is contained in the
Sacraments, and there are consequently no other religious acts than
those which are performed in Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper;
<i>then</i> I grant that the entire purport and positive result of my
work are bathing, eating, and drinking, since this work is nothing but
a faithful, rigid, historico-philosophical analysis of
religion&mdash;the revelation of religion to itself, the <i>awakening
of religion to self-consciousness</i>.</p>
<p>I say an <i>historico-philosophical</i> analysis, in distinction
from a merely <i>historical</i> analysis of Christianity. The
historical critic&mdash;such a one, for example, as Daumer or
Ghillany&mdash;shows that the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is a rite lineally
descended from the ancient cultus of human sacrifice; that once,
instead of bread and wine, real human flesh and blood were partaken. I,
on the contrary, take as the object of my analysis and reduction only
the Christian significance of the rite, that view of it which is
<i>sanctioned</i> Christianity, and I proceed on the supposition that
only <i>that significance</i> which a dogma or institution has in
Christianity (of course in ancient Christianity, not in modern),
whether it may present itself in other religions or not, is also the
<i>true origin</i> of that dogma or institution <i>in so far</i> as it
is <i>Christian</i>. Again, the historical critic, as, for example,
L&uuml;tzelberger, shows that the narratives of the miracles of Christ
resolve themselves into contradictions and absurdities, that they are
later fabrications, and that consequently Christ was no miracle-worker,
nor, in general, that which he is represented to be in the Bible. I, on
the other hand, do not inquire what the real, natural Christ was or may
have been in distinction from what he has been made or has become in
Supernaturalism; on the contrary, I accept the Christ of religion, but
I show that this superhuman being is nothing else than a product and
reflex of the supernatural human mind. I do not ask whether this or
that, or any miracle <i>can</i> happen <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e559" href="#xd21e559" name="xd21e559">xvi</a>]</span>or not; I
only show <i>what</i> miracle <i>is</i>, and I show it not <i>&agrave;
priori</i>, but by examples of miracles narrated in the Bible as real
events; in doing so, however, I answer or rather preclude the question
as to the possibility or reality of necessity of miracle. Thus much
concerning the distinction between me and the historical critics who
have attacked Christianity. As regards my relation to Strauss and Bruno
Bauer, in company with whom I am constantly named, I merely point out
here that the distinction between our works is sufficiently indicated
by the distinction between their objects, which is implied even in the
title-page. Bauer takes for the object of his criticism the evangelical
history, <i>i.e.</i>, biblical Christianity, or rather biblical
theology; Strauss, the System of Christian Doctrine and the Life of
Jesus (which may also be included under the title of Christian
Doctrine), <i>i.e.</i>, dogmatic Christianity, or rather dogmatic
theology; I, Christianity in general, <i>i.e.</i>, the Christian
<i>religion</i>, and consequently only Christian philosophy or
theology. Hence I take my citations chiefly from men in whom
Christianity was not merely a theory or a dogma, not merely theology,
but religion. My principal theme is Christianity, is Religion, as it is
the <i>immediate object</i>, the <i>immediate nature</i>, of man.
Erudition and philosophy are to me only the <i>means</i> by which I
bring to light the treasure hid in man.</p>
<p>I must further mention that the circulation which my work has had
amongst the public at large was neither desired nor expected by me. It
is true that I have always taken as the standard of the mode of
teaching and writing, not the abstract, particular, professional
philosopher, but universal man, that I have regarded <i>man</i> as the
criterion of truth, and not this or that founder of a system, and have
from the first placed the highest excellence of the philosopher in
this, that he abstains, both as a man and as an author, from the
ostentation of philosophy, <i>i.e.</i>, that he is a philosopher only
in reality, not formally, that he is a quiet philosopher, not a loud
and still less a brawling one. Hence, in all my works, as well as in
the present one, I have made the utmost clearness, simplicity, and
definiteness a law to myself, so that they may be understood, at least
in the main, by every cultivated and thinking man. But notwithstanding
this, my work can be appreciated and fully understood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e601" href="#xd21e601" name=
"xd21e601">xvii</a>]</span>only by the scholar, that is to say, by the
scholar who loves truth, who is capable of forming a judgment, who is
above the notions and prejudices of the learned and unlearned vulgar;
for although a thoroughly independent production, it has yet its
necessary logical basis in history. I very frequently refer to this or
that historical phenomenon without expressly designating it, thinking
this superfluous; and such references can be understood by the scholar
alone. Thus, for example, in the very first chapter, where I develop
the necessary consequences of the standpoint of Feeling, I allude to
Jacobi and Schleiermacher; in the second chapter I allude chiefly to
Kantism, Scepticism, Theism, Materialism and Pantheism; in the chapter
on the &ldquo;Standpoint of Religion,&rdquo; where I discuss the
contradictions between the religious or theological and the physical or
natural-philosophical view of Nature, I refer to philosophy in the age
of orthodoxy, and especially to the philosophy of Descartes and
Leibnitz, in which this contradiction presents itself in a peculiarly
characteristic manner. The reader, therefore, who is unacquainted with
the historical facts and ideas presupposed in my work, will fail to
perceive on what my arguments and ideas hinge; no wonder if my
positions often appear to him baseless, however firm the footing on
which they stand. It is true that the subject of my work is of
universal human interest; moreover, its fundamental ideas, though not
in the form in which they are here expressed, or in which they could be
expressed under existing circumstances, will one day become the common
property of mankind: for nothing is opposed to them in the present day
but empty, powerless illusions and prejudices in contradiction with the
true nature of man. But in considering this subject in the first
instance, I was under the necessity of treating it as a matter of
science, of philosophy; and in rectifying the aberrations of Religion,
Theology, and Speculation, I was naturally obliged to use their
expressions, and even to appear to speculate, or&mdash;which is the
same thing&mdash;to turn theologian myself, while I nevertheless only
analyse speculation, <i>i.e.</i>, reduce theology to anthropology. My
work, as I said before, contains, and applies in the concrete, the
principle of a new philosophy suited&mdash;not to the schools,
but&mdash;to man. Yes, it contains that principle, but only by
<i>evolving</i> it out of the very core of religion; hence, be it said
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e610" href="#xd21e610" name=
"xd21e610">xviii</a>]</span>in passing, the new philosophy can no
longer, like the old Catholic and modern Protestant scholasticism, fall
into the temptation to prove its agreement with religion by its
agreement with Christian dogmas; on the contrary, being evolved from
the nature of religion, it has in itself the true essence of
religion,&mdash;is, in its very quality as a philosophy, a religion
also. But a work which considers ideas in their genesis and explains
and demonstrates them in strict sequence, is, by the very form which
this purpose imposes upon it, unsuited to popular reading.</p>
<p>Lastly, as a supplement to this work with regard to many apparently
unvindicated positions, I refer to my articles in the <i lang=
"de">Deutsches Jahrbuch</i>, January and February 1842, to my critiques
and <i lang="de">Charakteristiken des modernen After-christenthums</i>,
in previous numbers of the same periodical, and to my earlier works,
especially the following:&mdash;<i lang="de">P. Bayle. Ein Beitrag zur
Geschichte der Philosophie und Menschheit</i>, Ausbach, 1838, and
<i lang="de">Philosophie und Christenthum</i>, Mannheim, 1839. In these
works I have sketched, with a few sharp touches, the historical
solution of Christianity, and have shown that Christianity has in fact
long vanished, not only from the reason but from the life of mankind,
that it is nothing more than a <i>fixed idea</i>, in flagrant
contradiction with our fire and life assurance companies, our railroads
and steam-carriages, our picture and sculpture galleries, our military
and industrial schools, our theatres and scientific museums.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&sect; 1. <i>The Essential Nature of Man.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Religion has its basis in the essential difference
between man and the brute&mdash;the brutes have no religion. It is true
that the old uncritical writers on natural history attributed to the
elephant, among other laudable qualities, the virtue of religiousness;
but the religion of elephants belongs to the realm of fable. Cuvier,
one of the greatest authorities on the animal kingdom, assigns, on the
strength of his personal observations, no higher grade of intelligence
to the elephant than to the dog.</p>
<p>But what is this essential difference between man and the brute? The
most simple, general, and also the most popular answer to this question
is&mdash;consciousness:&mdash;but consciousness in the strict sense;
for the consciousness implied in the feeling of self as an individual,
in discrimination by the senses, in the perception and even judgment of
outward things according to definite sensible signs, cannot be denied
to the brutes. Consciousness in the strictest sense is present only in
a being to whom his species, his essential nature, is an object of
thought. The brute is indeed conscious of himself as an
individual&mdash;and he has accordingly the feeling of self as the
common centre of successive sensations&mdash;but not as a species:
hence, he is without that consciousness which in its nature, as in its
name, is akin to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>science. Where there is this higher consciousness
there is a capability of science. Science is the cognisance of species.
In practical life we have to do with individuals; in science, with
species. But only a being to whom his own species, his own nature, is
an object of thought, can make the essential nature of other things or
beings an object of thought.</p>
<p>Hence the brute has only a simple, man a twofold life: in the brute,
the inner life is one with the outer; man has both an inner and an
outer life. The inner life of man is the life which has relation to his
species, to his general, as distinguished from his individual, nature.
Man thinks&mdash;that is, he converses with himself. The brute can
exercise no function which has relation to its species without another
individual external to itself; but man can perform the functions of
thought and speech, which strictly imply such a relation, apart from
another individual. Man is himself at once I and thou; he can put
himself in the place of another, for this reason, that to him his
species, his essential nature, and not merely his individuality, is an
object of thought.</p>
<p>Religion being identical with the distinctive characteristic of man,
is then identical with self-consciousness&mdash;with the consciousness
which man has of his nature. But religion, expressed generally, is
consciousness of the infinite; thus it is and can be nothing else than
the consciousness which man has of his own&mdash;not finite and
limited, but infinite nature. A really finite being has not even the
faintest adumbration, still less consciousness, of an infinite being,
for the limit of the nature is also the limit of the consciousness. The
consciousness of the caterpillar, whose life is confined to a
particular species of plant, does not extend itself beyond this narrow
domain. It does, indeed, discriminate between this plant and other
plants, but more it knows not. A consciousness so limited, but on
account of that very limitation so infallible, we do not call
consciousness, but instinct. Consciousness, in the strict or proper
sense, is identical with consciousness of the infinite; a limited
consciousness is no consciousness; consciousness is essentially
infinite in its nature.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1210src" href=
"#xd21e1210" name="xd21e1210src">1</a> The consciousness of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>infinite is nothing else than the consciousness of
the infinity of the consciousness; or, in the consciousness of the
infinite, the conscious subject has for his object the infinity of his
own nature.</p>
<p>What, then, <i>is</i> the nature of man, of which he is conscious,
or what constitutes the specific distinction, the proper humanity of
man?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1220src" href="#xd21e1220" name=
"xd21e1220src">2</a> Reason, Will, Affection. To a complete man belong
the power of thought, the power of will, the power of affection. The
power of thought is the light of the intellect, the power of will is
energy of character, the power of affection is love. Reason, love,
force of will, are perfections&mdash;the perfections of the human
being&mdash;nay, more, they are absolute perfections of being. To will,
to love, to think, are the highest powers, are the absolute nature of
man as man, and the basis of his existence. Man exists to think, to
love, to will. Now that which is the end, the ultimate aim, is also the
true basis and principle of a being. But what is the end of reason?
Reason. Of love? Love. Of will? Freedom of the will. We think for the
sake of thinking; love for the sake of loving; will for the sake of
willing&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, that we may be free. True existence is
thinking, loving, willing existence. That alone is true, perfect,
divine, which exists for its own sake. But such is love, such is
reason, such is will. The divine trinity in man, above the individual
man, is the unity of reason, love, will. Reason, Will, Love, are not
powers which man possesses, for he is nothing without them, he is what
he is only by them; they are the constituent elements of his nature,
which he neither has nor makes, the animating, determining, governing
powers&mdash;divine, absolute powers&mdash;to which he can oppose no
resistance.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1229src" href="#xd21e1229" name=
"xd21e1229src">3</a></p>
<p>How can the feeling man resist feeling, the loving one love, the
rational one reason? Who has not experienced the overwhelming power of
melody? And what else is the power of melody but the power of feeling?
Music is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>language of feeling; melody is audible
feeling&mdash;feeling communicating itself. Who has not experienced the
power of love, or at least heard of it? Which is the
stronger&mdash;love or the individual man? Is it man that possesses
love, or is it not much rather love that possesses man? When love
impels a man to suffer death even joyfully for the beloved one, is this
death-conquering power his own individual power, or is it not rather
the power of love? And who that ever truly thought has not experienced
that quiet, subtle power&mdash;the power of thought? When thou sinkest
into deep reflection, forgetting thyself and what is around thee, dost
thou govern reason, or is it not reason which governs and absorbs thee?
Scientific enthusiasm&mdash;is it not the most glorious triumph of
intellect over thee? The desire of knowledge&mdash;is it not a simply
irresistible, and all-conquering power? And when thou suppressest a
passion, renouncest a habit, in short, achievest a victory over
thyself, is this victorious power thy own personal power, or is it not
rather the energy of will, the force of morality, which seizes the
mastery of thee, and fills thee with indignation against thyself and
thy individual weaknesses?</p>
<p>Man is nothing without an object. The great models of humanity, such
men as reveal to us what man is capable of, have attested the truth of
this proposition by their lives. They had only one dominant
passion&mdash;the realisation of the aim which was the essential object
of their activity. But the object to which a subject essentially,
necessarily relates, is nothing else than this subject&rsquo;s own, but
objective, nature. If it be an object common to several individuals of
the same species, but under various conditions, it is still, at least
as to the form under which it presents itself to each of them according
to their respective modifications, their own, but objective,
nature.</p>
<p>Thus the Sun is the common object of the planets, but it is an
object to Mercury, to Venus, to Saturn, to Uranus, under other
conditions than to the Earth. Each planet has its own sun. The Sun
which lights and warms Uranus has no physical (only an astronomical,
scientific) existence for the Earth; and not only does the Sun appear
different, but it really is <i>another</i> sun on Uranus than on the
Earth. The relation of the Sun to the Earth is therefore at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>same time a relation of the Earth to itself, or to
its own nature, for the measure of the size and of the intensity of
light which the Sun possesses as the object of the Earth is the measure
of the distance which determines the peculiar nature of the Earth.
Hence each planet has in its sun the mirror of its own nature.</p>
<p>In the object which he contemplates, therefore, man becomes
acquainted with himself; consciousness of the objective is the
self-consciousness of man. We know the man by the object, by his
conception of what is external to himself; in it his nature becomes
evident; this object is his manifested nature, his true objective
<i>ego</i>. And this is true not merely of spiritual, but also of
sensuous objects. Even the objects which are the most remote from man,
<i>because</i> they are objects to him, and to the extent to which they
are so, are revelations of human nature. Even the moon, the sun, the
stars, call to man <span class="trans" title=
"Gn&#333;thi seauton"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Gamma;&nu;&#8182;&theta;&iota;
&sigma;&epsilon;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&#8057;&nu;</span></span>. That he
sees them, and so sees them, is an evidence of his own nature. The
animal is sensible only of the beam which immediately affects life;
while man perceives the ray, to him physically indifferent, of the
remotest star. Man alone has purely intellectual, disinterested joys
and passions; the eye of man alone keeps theoretic festivals. The eye
which looks into the starry heavens, which gazes at that light, alike
useless and harmless, having nothing in common with the earth and its
necessities&mdash;this eye sees in that light its own nature, its own
origin. The eye is heavenly in its nature. Hence man elevates himself
above the earth only with the eye; hence theory begins with the
contemplation of the heavens. The first philosophers were astronomers.
It is the heavens that admonish man of his destination, and remind him
that he is destined not merely to action, but also to
contemplation.</p>
<p>The <i>absolute</i> to man is his own nature. The power of the
object over him is therefore the power of his own nature. Thus the
power of the object of feeling is the power of feeling itself; the
power of the object of the intellect is the power of the intellect
itself; the power of the object of the will is the power of the will
itself. The man who is affected by musical sounds is governed by
feeling; by the feeling, that is, which finds its corresponding element
in musical sounds. But it is not melody as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>such, it is
only melody pregnant with meaning and emotion, which has power over
feeling. Feeling is only acted on by that which conveys feeling,
<i>i.e.</i>, by itself, its own nature. Thus also the will; thus, and
infinitely more, the intellect. Whatever kind of object, therefore, we
are at any time conscious of, we are always at the same time conscious
of our own nature; we can affirm nothing without affirming ourselves.
And since to will, to feel, to think, are perfections, essences,
realities, it is impossible that intellect, feeling, and will should
feel or perceive themselves as limited, finite powers, <i>i.e.</i>, as
worthless, as nothing. For finiteness and nothingness are identical;
finiteness is only a euphemism for nothingness. Finiteness is the
metaphysical, the theoretical&mdash;nothingness the pathological,
practical expression. What is finite to the understanding is nothing to
the heart. But it is impossible that we should be conscious of will,
feeling, and intellect, as finite powers, because every perfect
existence, every original power and essence, is the immediate
verification and affirmation of itself. It is impossible to love, will,
or think, without perceiving these activities to be
perfections&mdash;impossible to feel that one is a loving, willing,
thinking being, without experiencing an infinite joy therein.
Consciousness consists in a being becoming objective to itself; hence
it is nothing apart, nothing distinct from the being which is conscious
of itself. How could it otherwise become conscious of itself? It is
therefore impossible to be conscious of a perfection as an
imperfection, impossible to feel feeling limited, to think thought
limited.</p>
<p>Consciousness is self-verification, self-affirmation, self-love, joy
in one&rsquo;s own perfection. Consciousness is the characteristic mark
of a perfect nature; it exists only in a self-sufficing, complete
being. Even human vanity attests this truth. A man looks in the glass;
he has complacency in his appearance. This complacency is a necessary,
involuntary consequence of the completeness, the beauty of his form. A
beautiful form is satisfied in itself; it has necessarily joy in
itself&mdash;in self-contemplation. This complacency becomes vanity
only when a man piques himself on his form as being his individual
form, not when he admires it as a specimen of human beauty in general.
It is fitting that he should admire it thus: he can conceive no form
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>more beautiful, more sublime than the
human.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1279src" href="#xd21e1279" name=
"xd21e1279src">4</a> Assuredly every being loves itself, its
existence&mdash;and fitly so. To exist is a good. <i>Quidquid essentia
dignum est, scientia dignum est.</i> Everything that exists has value,
is a being of distinction&mdash;at least this is true of the species:
hence it asserts, maintains itself. But the highest form of
self-assertion, the form which is itself a superiority, a perfection, a
bliss, a good, is consciousness.</p>
<p>Every limitation of the reason, or in general of the nature of man,
rests on a delusion, an error. It is true that the human being, as an
individual, can and must&mdash;herein consists his distinction from the
brute&mdash;feel and recognise himself to be limited; but he can become
conscious of his limits, his finiteness, only because the perfection,
the infinitude of his species, is perceived by him, whether as an
object of feeling, of conscience, or of the thinking consciousness. If
he makes his own limitations the limitations of the species, this
arises from the mistake that he identifies himself immediately with the
species&mdash;a mistake which is intimately connected with the
individual&rsquo;s love of ease, sloth, vanity, and egoism. For a
limitation which I know to be merely mine humiliates, shames, and
perturbs me. Hence to free myself from this feeling of shame, from this
state of dissatisfaction, I convert the limits of my individuality into
the limits of human nature in general. What is incomprehensible to me
is incomprehensible to others; why should I trouble myself further? It
is no fault of mine; my understanding is not to blame, but the
understanding of the race. But it is a ludicrous and even culpable
error to define as finite and limited what constitutes the essence of
man, the nature of the species, which is the absolute nature of the
individual. Every being is sufficient to itself. No being can deny
itself, <i>i.e.</i>, its own nature; no being is a limited one to
itself. Rather, every being is in and by itself infinite&mdash;has its
God, its highest conceivable being, in itself. Every limit of a being
is cognisable only by another being out of and above him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>The life of
the ephemera is extraordinarily short in comparison with that of
longer-lived creatures; but nevertheless, for the ephemera this short
life is as long as a life of years to others. The leaf on which the
caterpillar lives is for it a world, an infinite space.</p>
<p>That which makes a being what it is, is its talent, its power, its
wealth, its adornment. How can it possibly hold its existence
non-existence, its wealth poverty, its talent incapacity? If the plants
had eyes, taste, and judgment, each plant would declare its own flower
the most beautiful; for its comprehension, its taste, would reach no
farther than its natural power of production. What the productive power
of its nature has brought forth as the highest, that must also its
taste, its judgment, recognise and affirm as the highest. What the
nature affirms, the understanding, the taste, the judgment, cannot
deny; otherwise the understanding, the judgment, would no longer be the
understanding and judgment of this particular being, but of some other.
The measure of the nature is also the measure of the understanding. If
the nature is limited, so also is the feeling, so also is the
understanding. But to a limited being its limited understanding is not
felt to be a limitation; on the contrary, it is perfectly happy and
contented with this understanding; it regards it, praises and values
it, as a glorious, divine power; and the limited understanding, on its
part, values the limited nature whose understanding it is. Each is
exactly adapted to the other; how should they be at issue with each
other? A being&rsquo;s understanding is its sphere of vision. As far as
thou seest, so far extends thy nature; and conversely. The eye of the
brute reaches no farther than its needs, and its nature no farther than
its needs. And so far as thy nature reaches, so far reaches thy
unlimited self-consciousness, so far art thou God. The discrepancy
between the understanding and the nature, between the power of
conception and the power of production in the human consciousness, on
the one hand, is merely of individual significance and has not a
universal application; and, on the other hand, it is only apparent. He
who, having written a bad poem, knows it to be bad, is in his
intelligence, and therefore in his nature, not so limited as he who,
having written a bad poem, admires it and thinks it good. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>It follows that if thou thinkest the infinite, thou perceivest and
affirmest the infinitude of the power of thought; if thou feelest the
infinite, thou feelest and affirmest the infinitude of the power of
feeling. The object of the intellect is intellect objective to itself;
the object of feeling is feeling objective to itself. If thou hast no
sensibility, no feeling for music, thou perceivest in the finest music
nothing more than in the wind that whistles by thy ear, or than in the
brook which rushes past thy feet. What, then, is it which acts on thee
when thou art affected by melody? What dost thou perceive in it? What
else than the voice of thy own heart? Feeling speaks only to feeling;
feeling is comprehensible only by feeling, that is, by itself&mdash;for
this reason, that the object of feeling is nothing else than feeling.
Music is a monologue of emotion. But the dialogue of philosophy also is
in truth only a monologue of the intellect; thought speaks only to
thought. The splendours of the crystal charm the sense, but the
intellect is interested only in the laws of crystallisation. The
intellectual only is the object of the intellect.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1297src" href="#xd21e1297" name="xd21e1297src">5</a></p>
<p>All therefore which, in the point of view of metaphysical,
transcendental speculation and religion, has the significance only of
the secondary, the subjective, the medium, the organ&mdash;has in truth
the significance of the primary, of the essence, of the object itself.
If, for example, feeling is the essential organ of religion, the nature
of God is nothing else than an expression of the nature of feeling. The
true but latent sense of the phrase, &ldquo;Feeling is the organ of the
divine,&rdquo; is, feeling is the noblest, the most excellent,
<i>i.e.</i>, the divine, in man. How couldst thou perceive the divine
by feeling, if feeling were not itself divine in its nature? The divine
assuredly is known only by means of the divine&mdash;God is known only
by himself. The divine nature which is discerned by feeling is in truth
nothing else than feeling enraptured, in ecstasy with
itself&mdash;feeling intoxicated with joy, blissful in its own
plenitude.</p>
<p>It is already clear from this that where feeling is held to be the
organ of the infinite, the subjective essence of religion,&mdash;the
external data of religion lose their objective value. And thus, since
feeling has been held the cardinal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10"
href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>principle in religion, the
doctrines of Christianity, formerly so sacred, have lost their
importance. If, from this point of view, some value is still conceded
to Christian ideas, it is a value springing entirely from the relation
they bear to feeling; if another object would excite the same emotions,
it would be just as welcome. But the object of religious feeling is
become a matter of indifference, only because when once feeling has
been pronounced to be the subjective essence of religion, it in fact is
also the objective essence of religion, though it may not be declared,
at least directly, to be such. I say directly; for indirectly this is
certainly admitted, when it is declared that feeling, as such, is
religious, and thus the distinction between specifically religious and
irreligious, or at least non-religious, feelings is abolished&mdash;a
necessary consequence of the point of view in which feeling only is
regarded as the organ of the divine. For on what other ground than that
of its essence, its nature, dost thou hold feeling to be the organ of
the infinite, the divine being? And is not the nature of feeling in
general also the nature of every special feeling, be its object what it
may? What, then, makes this feeling religious? A given object? Not at
all; for this object is itself a religious one only when it is not an
object of the cold understanding or memory, but of feeling. What then?
The nature of feeling&mdash;a nature of which every special feeling,
without distinction of objects, partakes. Thus, feeling is pronounced
to be religious, simply because it is feeling; the ground of its
religiousness is its own nature&mdash;lies in itself. But is not
feeling thereby declared to be itself the absolute, the divine? If
feeling in itself is good, religious, <i>i.e.</i>, holy, divine, has
not feeling its God in itself?</p>
<p>But if, notwithstanding, thou wilt posit an object of feeling, but
at the same time seekest to express thy feeling truly, without
introducing by thy reflection any foreign element, what remains to thee
but to distinguish between thy individual feeling and the general
nature of feeling;&mdash;to separate the universal in feeling from the
disturbing, adulterating influences with which feeling is bound up in
thee, under thy individual conditions? Hence what thou canst alone
contemplate, declare to be the infinite, and define as its essence, is
merely the nature of feeling. Thou hast thus no other definition of God
than this: God is pure, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>unlimited, free Feeling. Every other
God, whom thou supposest, is a God thrust upon thy feeling from
without. Feeling is atheistic in the sense of the orthodox belief,
which attaches religion to an external object; it denies an objective
God&mdash;it is itself God. In this point of view only the negation of
feeling is the negation of God. Thou art simply too cowardly or too
narrow to confess in words what thy feeling tacitly affirms. Fettered
by outward considerations, still in bondage to vulgar empiricism,
incapable of comprehending the spiritual grandeur of feeling, thou art
terrified before the religious atheism of thy heart. By this fear thou
destroyest the unity of thy feeling with itself, in imagining to
thyself an objective being distinct from thy feeling, and thus
necessarily sinking back into the old questions and doubts&mdash;is
there a God or not?&mdash;questions and doubts which vanish, nay, are
impossible, where feeling is defined as the essence of religion.
Feeling is thy own inward power, but at the same time a power distinct
from thee, and independent of thee; it is in thee, above thee; it is
itself that which constitutes the objective in thee&mdash;thy own being
which impresses thee as another being; in short, thy God. How wilt
thou, then, distinguish from this objective being within thee another
objective being? <span class="corr" id="xd21e1319" title=
"Source: how">How</span> wilt thou get beyond thy feeling?</p>
<p>But feeling has here been adduced only as an example. It is the same
with every other power, faculty, potentiality, reality,
activity&mdash;the name is indifferent&mdash;which is defined as the
essential organ of any object. Whatever is a subjective expression of a
nature is simultaneously also its objective expression. Man cannot get
beyond his true nature. He may indeed by means of the imagination
conceive individuals of another so-called higher kind, but he can never
get loose from his species, his nature; the conditions of being, the
positive final predicates which he gives to these other individuals,
are always determinations or qualities drawn from his own
nature&mdash;qualities in which he in truth only images and projects
himself. There may certainly be thinking beings besides men on the
other planets of our solar system. But by the supposition of such
beings we do not change our standing point&mdash;we extend our
conceptions <i>quantitatively</i> not <i>qualitatively</i>. For as
surely as on the other planets there are the same laws of motion, so
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>surely are there the same laws of perception and
thought as here. In fact, we people the other planets, not that we may
place there different beings from ourselves, but <i>more</i> beings of
our own or of a similar nature.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1335src"

Generally.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What we have hitherto been maintaining generally, even
with regard to sensational impressions, of the relation between subject
and object, applies especially to the relation between the subject and
the religious object.</p>
<p>In the perceptions of the senses consciousness of the object is
distinguishable from consciousness of self; but in religion,
consciousness of the object and self-consciousness coincide. The object
of the senses is out of man, the religious object is within him, and
therefore as little forsakes him as his self-consciousness or his
conscience; it is the intimate, the closest object. &ldquo;God,&rdquo;
says Augustine, for example, &ldquo;is nearer, more related to us, and
therefore more easily known by us, than sensible, corporeal
things.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1347src" href="#xd21e1347"
name="xd21e1347src">7</a> The object of the senses is in itself
indifferent&mdash;independent of the disposition or of the judgment;
but the object of religion is a selected object; the most excellent,
the first, the supreme being; it essentially presupposes a critical
judgment, a discrimination between the divine and the non-divine,
between that which is worthy of adoration and that which is not
worthy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1350src" href="#xd21e1350" name=
"xd21e1350src">8</a> And here may be applied, without any limitation,
the proposition: the object of any subject is nothing else than the
subject&rsquo;s own nature taken objectively. Such as are a man&rsquo;s
thoughts and dispositions, such is his God; so much worth as a man has,
so much and no more has his God. Consciousness of God is
self-consciousness, knowledge of God is self-knowledge. By his God thou
knowest the man, and by the man his God; the two are identical.
Whatever is God to a man, that is his heart and soul; and conversely,
God is the manifested inward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>nature, the expressed self of a
man,&mdash;religion the solemn unveiling of a man&rsquo;s hidden
treasures, the revelation of his intimate thoughts, the open confession
of his love-secrets.</p>
<p>But when religion&mdash;consciousness of God&mdash;is designated as
the self-consciousness of man, this is not to be understood as
affirming that the religious man is directly aware of this identity;
for, on the contrary, ignorance of it is fundamental to the peculiar
nature of religion. To preclude this misconception, it is better to
say, religion is man&rsquo;s earliest and also indirect form of
self-knowledge. Hence, religion everywhere precedes philosophy, as in
the history of the race, so also in that of the individual. Man first
of all sees his nature as if <i>out of</i> himself, before he finds it
in himself. His own nature is in the first instance contemplated by him
as that of another being. Religion is the childlike condition of
humanity; but the child sees his nature&mdash;man&mdash;out of himself;
in childhood a man is an object to himself, under the form of another
man. Hence the historical progress of religion consists in this: that
what by an earlier religion was regarded as objective, is now
recognised as subjective; that is, what was formerly contemplated and
worshipped as God is now perceived to be something <i>human</i>. What
was at first religion becomes at a later period idolatry; man is seen
to have adored his own nature. Man has given objectivity to himself,
but has not recognised the object as his own nature: a later religion
takes this forward step; every advance in religion is therefore a
deeper self-knowledge. But every particular religion, while it
pronounces its predecessors idolatrous, excepts itself&mdash;and
necessarily so, otherwise it would no longer be religion&mdash;from the
fate, the common nature of all religions: it imputes only to other
religions what is the fault, if fault it be, of religion in general.
Because it has a different object, a different tenor, because it has
transcended the ideas of preceding religions, it erroneously supposes
itself exalted above the necessary eternal laws which constitute the
essence of religion&mdash;it fancies its object, its ideas, to be
superhuman. But the essence of religion, thus hidden from the
religious, is evident to the thinker, by whom religion is viewed
objectively, which it cannot be by its votaries. And it is our task to
show that the antithesis of divine and human is altogether illusory,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>that it is nothing else than the antithesis
between the human nature in general and the human individual; that,
consequently, the object and contents of the Christian religion are
altogether human.</p>
<p>Religion, at least the Christian, is the relation of man to himself,
or more correctly to his own nature (<i>i.e.</i>, his subjective
nature);<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1379src" href="#xd21e1379" name=
"xd21e1379src">9</a> but a relation to it, viewed as a nature apart
from his own. The divine being is nothing else than the human being,
or, rather, the human nature purified, freed from the limits of the
individual man, made objective&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, contemplated and
revered as another, a distinct being. All the attributes of the divine
nature are, therefore, attributes of the human nature.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1385src" href="#xd21e1385" name=
"xd21e1385src">10</a></p>
<p>In relation to the attributes, the predicates, of the Divine Being,
this is admitted without hesitation, but by no means in relation to the
subject of these predicates. The negation of the subject is held to be
irreligion, nay, atheism; though not so the negation of the predicates.
But that which has no predicates or qualities, has no effect upon me;
that which has no effect upon me has no existence for me. To deny all
the qualities of a being is equivalent to denying the being himself. A
being without qualities is one which cannot become an object to the
mind, and such a being is virtually non-existent. Where man deprives
God of all qualities, God is no longer anything more to him than a
negative being. To the truly religious man, God is not a being without
qualities, because to him he is a positive, real being. The theory that
God cannot be defined, and consequently cannot be known by man, is
therefore the offspring of recent times, a product of modern
unbelief.</p>
<p>As reason is and can be pronounced finite only where man regards
sensual enjoyment, or religious emotion, or &aelig;sthetic
contemplation, or moral sentiment, as the absolute, the true; so the
proposition that God is unknowable or undefinable, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>can only
be enunciated and become fixed as a dogma, where this object has no
longer any interest for the intellect; where the real, the positive,
alone has any hold on man, where the real alone has for him the
significance of the essential, of the absolute, divine object, but
where at the same time, in contradiction with this purely worldly
tendency, there yet exist some old remains of religiousness. On the
ground that God is unknowable, man excuses himself to what is yet
remaining of his religious conscience for his forgetfulness of God, his
absorption in the world: he denies God practically by his
conduct,&mdash;the world has possession of all his thoughts and
inclinations,&mdash;but he does not deny him theoretically, he does not
attack his existence; he lets that rest. But this existence does not
affect or incommode him; it is a merely negative existence, an
existence without existence, a self-contradictory existence,&mdash;a
state of being which, as to its effects, is not distinguishable from
non-being. The denial of determinate, positive predicates concerning
the divine nature is nothing else than a denial of religion, with,
however, an appearance of religion in its favour, so that it is not
recognised as a denial; it is simply a subtle, disguised atheism. The
alleged religious horror of limiting God by positive predicates is only
the irreligious wish to know nothing more of God, to banish God from
the mind. Dread of limitation is dread of existence. All real
existence, <i>i.e.</i>, all existence which is truly such, is
qualitative, determinative existence. He who earnestly believes in the
Divine existence is not shocked at the attributing even of gross
sensuous qualities to God. He who dreads an existence that may give
offence, who shrinks from the grossness of a positive predicate, may as
well renounce existence altogether. A God who is injured by determinate
qualities has not the courage and the strength to exist. Qualities are
the fire, the vital breath, the oxygen, the salt of existence. An
existence in general, an existence without qualities, is an insipidity,
an absurdity. But there can be no more in God than is supplied by
religion. Only where man loses his taste for religion, and thus
religion itself becomes insipid, does the existence of God become an
insipid existence&mdash;an existence without qualities.</p>
<p>There is, however, a still milder way of denying the divine
predicates than the direct one just described. It is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>admitted
that the predicates of the divine nature are finite, and, more
particularly, human qualities, but their rejection is rejected; they
are even taken under protection, because it is necessary to man to have
a definite conception of God and since he is man he can form no other
than a human conception of him. In relation to God, it is said, these
predicates are certainly without any objective validity; but to me, if
he is to exist for me, he cannot appear otherwise than as he does
appear to me, namely, as a being with attributes analogous to the
human. But this distinction between what God is in himself, and what he
is for me destroys the peace of religion, and is besides in itself an
unfounded and untenable distinction. I cannot know whether God is
something else in himself or for himself than he is for me; what he is
to me is to me all that he is. For me, there lies in these predicates
under which he exists for me, what he is in himself, his very nature;
he is for me what he can alone ever be for me. The religious man finds
perfect satisfaction in that which God is in relation to himself; of
any other relation he knows nothing, for God is to him what he can
alone be to man. In the distinction above stated, man takes a point of
view above himself, <i>i.e.</i>, above his nature, the absolute measure
of his being; but this transcendentalism is only an illusion; for I can
make the distinction between the object as it is in itself, and the
object as it is for me, only where an object can really appear
otherwise to me, not where it appears to me such as the absolute
measure of my nature determines it to appear&mdash;such as it must
appear to me. It is true that I may have a merely subjective
conception, <i>i.e.</i>, one which does not arise out of the general
constitution of my species; but if my conception is determined by the
constitution of my species, the distinction between what an object is
in itself, and what it is for me ceases; for this conception is itself
an absolute one. The measure of the species is the absolute measure,
law, and criterion of man. And, indeed, religion has the conviction
that its conceptions, its predicates of God, are such as every man
ought to have, and must have, if he would have the true ones&mdash;that
they are the conceptions necessary to human nature; nay, further, that
they are objectively true, representing God as he is. To every religion
the gods of <i>other</i> religious are only notions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>concerning God, but its own conception of God is
to it God himself, the true God&mdash;God such as he is in himself.
Religion is satisfied only with a complete Deity, a God without
reservation; it will not have a mere phantasm of God; it demands God
himself. Religion gives up its own existence when it gives up the
nature of God; it is no longer a truth when it renounces the possession
of the true God. Scepticism is the arch-enemy of religion; but the
distinction between object and conception&mdash;between God as he is in
himself, and God as he is for me&mdash;is a sceptical distinction, and
therefore an irreligious one.</p>
<p>That which is to man the self-existent, the highest being, to which
he can conceive nothing higher&mdash;that is to him the Divine Being.
How then should he inquire concerning this being, what he is in
himself? If God were an object to the bird, he would be a winged being:
the bird knows nothing higher, nothing more blissful, than the winged
condition. How ludicrous would it be if this bird pronounced: To me God
appears as a bird, but what he is in himself I know not. To the bird
the highest nature is the bird-nature; take from him the conception of
this, and you take from him the conception of the highest being. How,
then, could he ask whether God in himself were winged? To ask whether
God is in himself what he is for me, is to ask whether God is God, is
to lift oneself above one&rsquo;s God, to rise up against him.</p>
<p>Wherever, therefore, this idea, that the religious predicates are
only anthropomorphisms, has taken possession of a man, there has doubt,
has unbelief, obtained the mastery of faith. And it is only the
inconsequence of faint-heartedness and intellectual imbecility which
does not proceed from this idea to the formal negation of the
predicates, and from thence to the negation of the subject to which
they relate. If thou doubtest the objective truth of the predicates,
thou must also doubt the objective truth of the subject whose
predicates they are. If thy predicates are anthropomorphisms, the
subject of them is an anthropomorphism too. If love, goodness,
personality, &amp;c., are human attributes, so also is the subject
which thou presupposest, the existence of God, the belief that there is
a God, an anthropomorphism&mdash;a presupposition purely human. Whence
knowest thou that the belief in a God <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>at all is not a
limitation of man&rsquo;s mode of conception? Higher beings&mdash;and
thou supposest such&mdash;are perhaps so blest in themselves, so at
unity with themselves, that they are not hung in suspense between
themselves and a yet higher being. To know God and not oneself to be
God, to know blessedness and not oneself to enjoy it, is a state of
disunity, of unhappiness. Higher beings know nothing of this
unhappiness; they have no conception of that which they are not.</p>
<p>Thou believest in love as a divine attribute because thou thyself
lovest; thou believest that God is a wise, benevolent being because
thou knowest nothing better in thyself than benevolence and wisdom; and
thou believest that God exists, that therefore he is a
subject&mdash;whatever exists is a subject, whether it be defined as
substance, person, essence, or otherwise&mdash;because thou thyself
existest, art thyself a subject. Thou knowest no higher human good than
to love, than to be good and wise; and even so thou knowest no higher
happiness than to exist, to be a subject; for the consciousness of all
reality, of all bliss, is for thee bound up in the consciousness of
being a subject, of existing. God is an existence, a subject to thee,
for the same reason that he is to thee a wise, a blessed, a personal
being. The distinction between the divine predicates and the divine
subject is only this, that to thee the subject, the existence, does not
appear an anthropomorphism, because the conception of it is necessarily
involved in thy own existence as a subject, whereas the predicates do
appear anthropomorphisms, because their necessity&mdash;the necessity
that God should be conscious, wise, good, &amp;c.,&mdash;is not an
immediate necessity, identical with the being of man, but is evolved by
his self-consciousness, by the activity of his thought. I am a subject,
I exist, whether I be wise or unwise, good or bad. To exist is to man
the first datum; it constitutes the very idea of the subject; it is
presupposed by the predicates. Hence man relinquishes the predicates,
but the existence of God is to him a settled, irrefragable, absolutely
certain, objective truth. But, nevertheless, this distinction is merely
an apparent one. The necessity of the subject lies only in the
necessity of the predicate. Thou art a subject only in so far as thou
art a human subject; the certainty and reality of thy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>existence lie only in the certainty and reality of
thy human attributes. What the subject is lies only in the predicate;
the predicate is the <i>truth</i> of the subject&mdash;the subject only
the personified, existing predicate, the predicate conceived as
existing. Subject and predicate are distinguished only as existence and
essence. The negation of the predicates is therefore the negation of
the subject. What remains of the human subject when abstracted from the
human attributes? Even in the language of common life the divine
predicates&mdash;Providence, Omniscience, Omnipotence&mdash;are put for
the divine subject.</p>
<p>The certainty of the existence of God, of which it has been said
that it is as certain, nay, more certain to man than his own existence,
depends only on the certainty of the qualities of God&mdash;it is in
itself no immediate certainty. To the Christian the existence of the
Christian God only is a certainty; to the heathen that of the heathen
God only. The heathen did not doubt the existence of Jupiter, because
he took no offence at the nature of Jupiter, because he could conceive
of God under no other qualities, because to him these qualities were a
certainty, a divine reality. The reality of the predicate is the sole
guarantee of existence.</p>
<p>Whatever man conceives to be true, he immediately conceives to be
real (that is, to have an objective existence), because, originally,
only the real is true to him&mdash;true in opposition to what is merely
conceived, dreamed, imagined. The idea of being, of existence, is the
original idea of truth; or, originally, man makes truth dependent on
existence, subsequently, existence dependent on truth. Now God is the
nature of man regarded as absolute truth,&mdash;the truth of man; but
God, or, what is the same thing, religion, is as various as are the
conditions under which man conceives this his nature, regards it as the
highest being. These conditions, then, under which man conceives God,
are to him the truth, and for that reason they are also the highest
existence, or rather they are existence itself; for only the emphatic,
the highest existence, is existence, and deserves this name. Therefore,
God is an existent, real being, on the very same ground that he is a
particular, definite being; for the qualities of God are nothing else
than the essential qualities of man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20"
href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>himself, and a particular man is
what he is, has his existence, his reality, only in his particular
conditions. Take away from the Greek the quality of being Greek, and
you take away his existence. On this ground it is true that for a
definite positive religion&mdash;that is, relatively&mdash;the
certainty of the existence of God is <i>immediate</i>; for just as
involuntarily, as necessarily, as the Greek was a Greek, so necessarily
were his gods Greek beings, so necessarily were they real, existent
beings. Religion is that conception of the nature of the world and of
man which is essential to, <i>i.e.</i>, identical with, a man&rsquo;s
nature. But man does not stand above this his necessary conception; on
the contrary, it stands above him; it animates, determines, governs
him. The necessity of a proof, of a middle term to unite qualities with
existence, the possibility of a doubt, is abolished. Only that which is
apart from my own being is capable of being doubted by me. How then can
I doubt of God, who is my being? To doubt of God is to doubt of myself.
Only when God is thought of abstractly, when his predicates are the
result of philosophic abstraction, arises the distinction or separation
between subject and predicate, existence and nature&mdash;arises the
fiction that the existence or the subject is something else than the
predicate, something immediate, indubitable, in distinction from the
predicate, which is held to be doubtful. But this is only a fiction. A
God who has abstract predicates has also an abstract existence.
Existence, being, varies with varying qualities.</p>
<p>The identity of the subject and predicate is clearly evidenced by
the progressive development of religion, which is identical with the
progressive development of human culture. So long as man is in a mere
state of nature, so long is his god a mere nature-god&mdash;a
personification of some natural force. Where man inhabits houses, he
also encloses his gods in temples. The temple is only a manifestation
of the value which man attaches to beautiful buildings. Temples in
honour of religion are in truth temples in honour of architecture. With
the emerging of man from a state of savagery and wildness to one of
culture, with the distinction between what is fitting for man and what
is not fitting, arises simultaneously the distinction between that
which is fitting and that which is not fitting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>for God.
God is the idea of majesty, of the highest dignity: the religious
sentiment is the sentiment of supreme fitness. The later more cultured
artists of Greece were the first to embody in the statues of the gods
the ideas of dignity, of spiritual grandeur, of imperturbable repose
and serenity. But why were these qualities in their view attributes,
predicates of God? Because they were in themselves regarded by the
Greeks as divinities. Why did those artists exclude all disgusting and
low passions? Because they perceived them to be unbecoming, unworthy,
unhuman, and consequently ungodlike. The Homeric gods eat and
drink;&mdash;that implies eating and drinking is a divine pleasure.
Physical strength is an attribute of the Homeric gods: Zeus is the
strongest of the gods. Why? Because physical strength, in and by
itself, was regarded as something glorious, divine. To the ancient
Germans the highest virtues were those of the warrior; therefore their
supreme god was the god of war, Odin,&mdash;war, &ldquo;the original or
oldest law.&rdquo; Not the attribute of the divinity, but the
divineness or deity of the attribute, is the first true Divine Being.
Thus what theology and philosophy have held to be God, the Absolute,
the Infinite, is not God; but that which they have held not to be God
is God: namely, the attribute, the quality, whatever has reality. Hence
he alone is the true atheist to whom the predicates of the Divine
Being,&mdash;for example, love, wisdom, justice,&mdash;are nothing; not
he to whom merely the subject of these predicates is nothing. And in no
wise is the negation of the subject necessarily also a negation of the
predicates considered in themselves. These have an intrinsic,
independent reality; they force their recognition upon man by their
very nature; they are self-evident truths to him; they prove, they
attest themselves. It does not follow that goodness, justice, wisdom,
are chim&aelig;ras because the existence of God is a chim&aelig;ra, nor
truths because this is a truth. The idea of God is dependent on the
idea of justice, of benevolence; a God who is not benevolent, not just,
not wise, is no God; but the converse does not hold. The fact is not
that a quality is divine because God has it, but that God has it
because it is in itself divine: because without it God would be a
defective being. Justice, wisdom, in general every quality which
constitutes the divinity of God, is determined and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>known by
itself independently, but the idea of God is determined by the
qualities which have thus been previously judged to be worthy of the
divine nature; only in the case in which I identify God and justice, in
which I think of God immediately as the reality of the idea of justice,
is the idea of God self-determined. But if God as a subject is the
determined, while the quality, the predicate, is the determining, then
in truth the rank of the godhead is due not to the subject, but to the
predicate.</p>
<p>Not until several, and those contradictory, attributes are united in
one being, and this being is conceived as personal&mdash;the
personality being thus brought into especial prominence&mdash;not until
then is the origin of religion lost sight of, is it forgotten that what
the activity of the reflective power has converted into a predicate
distinguishable or separable from the subject, was originally the true
subject. Thus the Greeks and Romans deified accidents as substances;
virtues, states of mind, passions, as independent beings. Man,
especially the religious man, is to himself the measure of all things,
of all reality. Whatever strongly impresses a man, whatever produces an
unusual effect on his mind, if it be only a peculiar, inexplicable
sound or note, he personifies as a divine being. Religion embraces all
the objects of the world: everything existing has been an object of
religious reverence; in the nature and consciousness of religion there
is nothing else than what lies in the nature of man and in his
consciousness of himself and of the world. Religion has no material
exclusively its own. In Rome even the passions of fear and terror had
their temples. The Christians also made mental phenomena into
independent beings, their own feelings into qualities of things, the
passions which governed them into powers which governed the world, in
short, predicates of their own nature, whether recognised as such or
not, into independent subjective existences. Devils, cobolds, witches,
ghosts, angels, were sacred truths as long as the religious spirit held
undivided sway over mankind.</p>
<p>In order to banish from the mind the identity of the divine and
human predicates, and the consequent identity of the divine and human
nature, recourse is had to the idea that God, as the absolute, real
Being, has an infinite fulness of various predicates, of which we here
know only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>a part, and those such as are analogous to our
own; while the rest, by virtue of which God must thus have quite a
different nature from the human or that which is analogous to the
human, we shall only know in the future&mdash;that is, after death. But
an infinite plenitude or multitude of predicates which are really
different, so different that the one does not immediately involve the
other, is realised only in an infinite plenitude or multitude of
different beings or individuals. Thus the human nature presents an
infinite abundance of different predicates, and for that very reason it
presents an infinite abundance of different individuals. Each new man
is a new predicate, a new phasis of humanity. As many as are the men,
so many are the powers, the properties of humanity. It is true that
there are the same elements in every individual, but under such various
conditions and modifications that they appear new and peculiar. The
mystery of the inexhaustible fulness of the divine predicates is
therefore nothing else than the mystery of human nature considered as
an infinitely varied, infinitely modifiable, but, consequently,
phenomenal being. Only in the realm of the senses, only in space and
time, does there exist a being of really infinite qualities or
predicates. Where there are really different predicates there are
different times. One man is a distinguished musician, a distinguished
author, a distinguished physician; but he cannot compose music, write
books, and perform cures in the same moment of time. Time, and not the
Hegelian dialectic, is the medium of uniting opposites,
contradictories, in one and the same subject. But distinguished and
detached from the nature of man, and combined with the idea of God, the
infinite fulness of various predicates is a conception without reality,
a mere phantasy, a conception derived from the sensible world, but
without the essential conditions, without the truth of sensible
existence, a conception which stands in direct contradiction with the
Divine Being considered as a spiritual, i.e., an abstract, simple,
single being; for the predicates of God are precisely of this
character, that one involves all the others, because there is no real
difference between them. If, therefore, in the present predicates I
have not the future, in the present God not the future God, then the
future God <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>is not the present, but they are two distinct
beings.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1461src" href="#xd21e1461" name=
"xd21e1461src">11</a> But this distinction is in contradiction with the
unity and simplicity of the theological God. Why is a given predicate a
predicate of God? Because it is divine in its nature, i.e., because it
expresses no limitation, no defect. Why are other predicates applied to
him? Because, however various in themselves, they agree in this, that
they all alike express perfection, unlimitedness. Hence I can conceive
innumerable predicates of God, because they must all agree with the
abstract idea of the Godhead, and must have in common that which
constitutes every single predicate a divine attribute. Thus it is in
the system of Spinoza. He speaks of an infinite number of attributes of
the divine substance, but he specifies none except Thought and
Extension. Why? Because it is a matter of indifference to know them;
nay, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1464" title=
"Source: Because">because</span> they are in themselves indifferent,
superfluous; for with all these innumerable predicates, I yet always
mean to say the same thing as when I speak of Thought and Extension.
Why is Thought an attribute of substance? Because, according to
Spinoza, it is capable of being conceived by itself, because it
expresses something indivisible, perfect, infinite. Why Extension or
Matter? For the same reason. Thus, substance can have an indefinite
number of predicates, because it is not their specific definition,
their difference, but their identity, their equivalence, which makes
them attributes of substance. Or rather, substance has innumerable
predicates only because (how strange!) it has properly no predicate;
that is, no definite, real predicate. The indefinite unity which is the
product of thought, completes itself by the indefinite multiplicity
which is the product of the imagination. Because the predicate is not
<i lang="la">multum</i>, it is <i lang="la">multa</i>. In truth, the
positive predicates are Thought and Extension. In these two infinitely
more is said than in the nameless innumerable predicates; for they
express something definite&mdash;in them I have something. But
substance is too indifferent, too apathetic to be <i>something</i>;
that is, to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>qualities and passions; that it may not be
something, it is rather nothing.</p>
<p>Now, when it is shown that what the subject is lies entirely in the
attributes of the subject; that is, that the predicate is the true
subject; it is also proved that if the divine predicates are attributes
of the human nature, the subject of those predicates is also of the
human nature. But the divine predicates are partly general, partly
personal. The general predicates are the metaphysical, but these serve
only as external points of support to religion; they are not the
characteristic definitions of religion. It is the personal predicates
alone which constitute the essence of religion&mdash;in which the
Divine Being is the object of religion. Such are, for example, that God
is a Person, that he is the moral Lawgiver, the Father of mankind, the
Holy One, the Just, the Good, the Merciful. It is, however, at once
clear, or it will at least be clear in the sequel, with regard to these
and other definitions, that, especially as applied to a personality,
they are purely human definitions, and that consequently man in
religion&mdash;in his relation to God&mdash;is in relation to his own
nature; for to the religious sentiment these predicates are not mere
conceptions, mere images, which man forms of God, to be distinguished
from that which God is in himself, but truths, facts, realities.
Religion knows nothing of anthropomorphisms; to it they are not
anthropomorphisms. It is the very essence of religion, that to it these
definitions express the nature of God. They are pronounced to be images
only by the understanding, which reflects on religion, and which while
defending them yet before its own tribunal denies them. But to the
religious sentiment God is a real Father, real Love and Mercy; for to
it he is a real, living, personal being, and therefore his attributes
are also living and personal. Nay, the definitions which are the most
sufficing to the religious sentiment are precisely those which give the
most offence to the understanding, and which in the process of
reflection on religion it denies. Religion is essentially emotion;
hence, objectively also, emotion is to it necessarily of a divine
nature. Even anger appears to it an emotion not unworthy of God,
provided only there be a religious motive at the foundation of this
anger.</p>
<p>But here it is also essential to observe, and this phenomenon is an
extremely remarkable one, characterising the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>very
core of religion, that in proportion as the divine subject is in
reality human, the greater is the apparent difference between God and
man; that is, the more, by reflection on religion, by theology, is the
identity of the divine and human denied, and the human, considered as
such, is depreciated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1485src" href=
"#xd21e1485" name="xd21e1485src">12</a> The reason of this is, that as
what is positive in the conception of the divine being can only be
human, the conception of man, as an object of consciousness, can only
be negative. To enrich God, man must become poor; that God may be all,
man must be nothing. But he desires to be nothing in himself, because
what he takes from himself is not lost to him, since it is preserved in
God. Man has his being in God; why then should he have it in himself?
Where is the necessity of positing the same thing twice, of having it
twice? What man withdraws from himself, what he renounces in himself,
he only enjoys in an incomparably higher and fuller measure in God.</p>
<p>The monks made a vow of chastity to God; they mortified the sexual
passion in themselves, but therefore they had in heaven, in the Virgin
Mary, the image of woman&mdash;an image of love. They could the more
easily dispense with real woman in proportion as an ideal woman was an
object of love to them. The greater the importance they attached to the
denial of sensuality, the greater the importance of the heavenly virgin
for them: she was to them in the place of Christ, in the stead of God.
The more the sensual tendencies are renounced, the more sensual is the
God to whom they are sacrificed. For whatever is made an offering to
God has an especial value attached to it; in it God is supposed to have
especial pleasure. That which is the highest in the estimation of man
is naturally the highest in the estimation of his God; what pleases man
pleases God also. The Hebrews did not offer to Jehovah unclean,
ill-conditioned animals; on the contrary, those which they most highly
prized, which they themselves ate, were also the food of God (<i lang=
"la">Cibus Dei</i>, <a class="biblink xd21e48" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lv%203:2">Lev. iii.
2</a><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>). Wherever, therefore, the denial of the sensual
delights is made a special offering, a sacrifice well-pleasing to God,
there the highest value is attached to the senses, and the sensuality
which has been renounced is unconsciously restored, in the fact that
God takes the place of the material delights which have been renounced.
The nun weds herself to God; she has a heavenly bridegroom, the monk a
heavenly bride. But the heavenly virgin is only a sensible presentation
of a general truth, having relation to the essence of religion. Man
denies as to himself only what he attributes to God. Religion abstracts
from man, from the world; but it can only abstract from the
limitations, from the phenomena; in short, from the negative, not from
the essence, the positive, of the world and humanity: hence, in the
very abstraction and negation it must recover that from which it
abstracts, or believes itself to abstract. And thus, in reality,
whatever religion consciously denies&mdash;always supposing that what
is denied by it is something essential, true, and consequently
incapable of being ultimately denied&mdash;it unconsciously restores in
God. Thus, in religion man denies his reason; of himself he knows
nothing of God, his thoughts are only worldly, earthly; he can only
believe what God reveals to him. But on this account the thoughts of
God are human, earthly thoughts: like man, he has plans in his mind, he
accommodates himself to circumstances and grades of intelligence, like
a tutor with his pupils; he calculates closely the effect of his gifts
and revelations; he observes man in all his doings; he knows all
things, even the most earthly, the commonest, the most trivial. In
brief, man in relation to God denies his own knowledge, his own
thoughts, that he may place them in God. Man gives up his personality;
but in return, God, the Almighty, infinite, unlimited being, is a
person; he denies human dignity, the human <i>ego</i>; but in return
God is to him a selfish, egoistical being, who in all things seeks only
himself, his own honour, his own ends; he represents God as simply
seeking the satisfaction of his own selfishness, while yet he frowns on
that of every other being; his God is the very luxury of
egoism.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1500src" href="#xd21e1500" name=
"xd21e1500src">13</a> Religion further denies goodness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>as a
quality of human nature; man is wicked, corrupt, incapable of good;
but, on the other hand, God is only good&mdash;the Good Being.
Man&rsquo;s nature demands as an object goodness, personified as God;
but is it not hereby declared that goodness is an essential tendency of
man? If my heart is wicked, my understanding perverted, how can I
perceive and feel the holy to be holy, the good to be good? Could I
perceive the beauty of a fine picture if my mind were
&aelig;sthetically an absolute piece of perversion? Though I may not be
a painter, though I may not have the power of producing what is
beautiful myself, I must yet have &aelig;sthetic feeling,
&aelig;sthetic comprehension, since I perceive the beauty that is
presented to me externally. Either goodness does not exist at all for
man, or, if it does exist, therein is revealed to the individual man
the holiness and goodness of human nature. That which is absolutely
opposed to my nature, to which I am united by no bond of sympathy, is
not even conceivable or perceptible by me. The holy is in opposition to
me only as regards the modifications of my personality, but as regards
my fundamental nature it is in unity with me. The holy is a reproach to
my sinfulness; in it I recognise myself as a sinner; but in so doing,
while I blame myself, I acknowledge what I am not, but ought to be, and
what, for that very reason, I, according to my destination, can be; for
an &ldquo;ought&rdquo; which has no corresponding capability does not
affect me, is a ludicrous chim&aelig;ra without any true relation to my
mental constitution. But when I acknowledge goodness as my destination,
as my law, I acknowledge it, whether consciously or unconsciously, as
my own nature. Another nature than my own, one different in quality,
cannot touch me. I can perceive sin as sin, only when I perceive it to
be a contradiction of myself with myself&mdash;that is, of my
personality with my fundamental nature. As a contradiction of the
absolute, considered as another being, the feeling of sin is
inexplicable, unmeaning.</p>
<p>The distinction between Augustinianism and Pelagianism consists only
in this, that the former expresses after the manner of religion what
the latter expresses after the manner of Rationalism. Both say the same
thing, both vindicate the goodness of man; but Pelagianism does it
directly, in a rationalistic and moral form; Augustinianism
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>indirectly, in a mystical, that is, a religious
form.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1514src" href="#xd21e1514" name=
"xd21e1514src">14</a> For that which is given to man&rsquo;s God is in
truth given to man himself; what a man declares concerning God, he in
truth declares concerning himself. Augustinianism would be a truth, and
a truth opposed to Pelagianism, only if man had the devil for his God,
and, with the consciousness that he was the devil, honoured,
reverenced, and worshipped him as the highest being. But so long as man
adores a good being as his God, so long does he contemplate in God the
goodness of his own nature.</p>
<p>As with the doctrine of the radical corruption of human nature, so
is it with the identical doctrine, that man can do nothing good,
<i>i.e.</i>, in truth, nothing of himself&mdash;by his own strength.
For the denial of human strength and spontaneous moral activity to be
true, the moral activity of God must also be denied; and we must say,
with the Oriental nihilist or pantheist: the Divine being is absolutely
without will or action, indifferent, knowing nothing of the
discrimination between evil and good. But he who defines God as an
active being, and not only so, but as morally active and morally
critical,&mdash;as a being who loves, works, and rewards good,
punishes, rejects, and condemns evil,&mdash;he who thus defines God
only in appearance denies human activity, in fact, making it the
highest, the most real activity. He who makes God act humanly, declares
human activity to be divine; he says: A god who is not active, and not
morally or humanly active, is no god; and thus he makes the idea of the
Godhead dependent on the idea of activity, that is, of human activity,
for a higher he knows not.</p>
<p>Man&mdash;this is the mystery of religion&mdash;projects his being
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>into objectivity,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1532src" href="#xd21e1532" name="xd21e1532src">15</a> and then
again makes himself an object to this projected image of himself thus
converted into a subject; he thinks of himself<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1535" title="Not in source">,</span> is an object to himself, but
as the object of an object, of another being than himself. Thus here.
Man is an object to God. That man is good or evil is not indifferent to
God; no! He has a lively, profound interest in man&rsquo;s being good;
he wills that man should be good, happy&mdash;for without goodness
there is no happiness. Thus the religious man virtually retracts the
nothingness of human activity, by making his dispositions and actions
an object to God, by making man the end of God&mdash;for that which is
an object to the mind is an end in action; by making the divine
activity a means of human salvation. God acts, that man may be good and
happy. Thus man, while he is apparently humiliated to the lowest
degree, is in truth exalted to the highest. Thus, in and through God,
man has in view himself alone. It is true that man places the aim of
his action in God, but God has no other aim of action than the moral
and eternal salvation of man: thus man has in fact no other aim than
himself. The divine activity is not distinct from the human.</p>
<p>How could the divine activity work on me as its object, nay, work in
me, if it were essentially different from me; how could it have a human
aim, the aim of ameliorating and blessing man, if it were not itself
human? Does not the purpose determine the nature of the act? When man
makes his moral improvement an aim to himself, he has divine
resolutions, divine projects; but also, when God seeks the salvation of
man, he has human ends and a human mode of activity corresponding to
these ends. Thus in God man has only his own activity as an object. But
for the very reason that he regards his own activity as objective,
goodness only as an object, he necessarily receives the impulse, the
motive not from himself, but from this object. He contemplates his
nature as external to himself, and this nature as goodness; thus it is
self-evident, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>it is mere tautology to say that the impulse to
good comes only from thence where he places the good.</p>
<p>God is the highest subjectivity of man abstracted from himself;
hence man can do nothing of himself, all goodness comes from God. The
more subjective God is, the more completely does man divest himself of
his subjectivity, because God is, <i>per se</i>, his relinquished self,
the possession of which he however again vindicates to himself. As the
action of the arteries drives the blood into the extremities, and the
action of the veins brings it back again, as life in general consists
in a perpetual systole and diastole; so is it in religion. In the
religious systole man propels his own nature from himself, he throws
himself outward; in the religious diastole he receives the rejected
nature into his heart again. God alone is the being who acts of
himself,&mdash;this is the force of repulsion in religion; God is the
being who acts in me, with me, through me, upon me, for me, is the
principle of my salvation, of my good dispositions and actions,
consequently my own good principle and nature,&mdash;this is the force
of attraction in religion.</p>
<p>The course of religious development which has been generally
indicated consists specifically in this, that man abstracts more and
more from God, and attributes more and more to himself. This is
especially apparent in the belief in revelation. That which to a later
age or a cultured people is given by nature or reason, is to an earlier
age, or to a yet uncultured people, given by God. Every tendency of
man, however natural&mdash;even the impulse to cleanliness, was
conceived by the Israelites as a positive divine ordinance. From this
example we again see that God is lowered, is conceived more entirely on
the type of ordinary humanity, in proportion as man detracts from
himself. How can the self-humiliation of man go further than when he
disclaims the capability of fulfilling spontaneously the requirements
of common decency?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1550src" href=
"#xd21e1550" name="xd21e1550src">16</a> The Christian religion, on the
other hand, distinguished the impulses and passions of man according to
their quality, their character; it represented only good emotions, good
dispositions, good thoughts, as revelations, operations&mdash;that is,
as dispositions, feelings, thoughts,&mdash;of God; for what God reveals
is a quality of God himself: that of which the heart is full overflows
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>lips; as is the effect such is the cause; as the
revelation, such the being who reveals himself. A God who reveals
himself in good dispositions is a God whose essential attribute is only
moral perfection. The Christian religion distinguishes inward moral
purity from external physical purity; the Israelites identified the
two.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1557src" href="#xd21e1557" name=
"xd21e1557src">17</a> In relation to the Israelitish religion, the
Christian religion is one of criticism and freedom. The Israelite
trusted himself to do nothing except what was commanded by God; he was
without will even in external things; the authority of religion
extended itself even to his food. The Christian religion, on the other
hand, in all these external things made man dependent on himself,
<i>i.e.</i>, placed in man what the Israelite placed out of himself in
God. Israel is the most complete presentation of Positivism in
religion. In relation to the Israelite, the Christian is an <i lang=
"fr">esprit fort</i>, a free-thinker. Thus do things change. What
yesterday was still religion is no longer such to-day; and what to-day
is atheism, to-morrow will be religion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Pelagianism denies God, religion&mdash;<span lang="la">isti tantam
tribuunt potestatem voluntati, ut pietati auferant orationem. (Augustin
de Nat. et Grat. cont. Pelagium, c. 58.)</span> It has only the
Creator, <i>i.e.</i>, Nature, as a basis, not the Saviour, the true God
of the religious sentiment&mdash;in a word, it denies God; but, as a
consequence of this, it elevates man into a God, since it makes him a
being not needing God, self-sufficing, independent. (See on this
subject Luther against Erasmus and Augustine, l. c. c. 33.)
Augustinianism denies man; but, as a consequence of this, it reduces
God to the level of man, even to the ignominy of the cross, for the
sake of man. The former puts man in the place of God, the latter puts
God in the place of man; both lead to the same result&mdash;the
distinction is only apparent, a pious illusion. Augustinianism is only
an inverted Pelagianism; what to the latter is a subject, is to the

<h2 class="main">GOD AS A BEING OF THE UNDERSTANDING.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Religion is the disuniting of man from himself; he
sets God before him as the antithesis of himself. God is not what man
is&mdash;man is not what God is. God is the infinite, man the finite
being; God is perfect, man imperfect; God eternal, man temporal; God
almighty, man weak; God holy, man sinful. God and man are extremes: God
is the absolutely positive, the sum of all realities; man the
absolutely negative, comprehending all negations.</p>
<p>But in religion man contemplates his own latent nature. Hence it
must be shown that this antithesis, this differencing of God and man,
with which religion begins, is a differencing of man with his own
nature.</p>
<p>The inherent necessity of this proof is at once apparent from
this,&mdash;that if the divine nature, which is the object of religion,
were really different from the nature of man, a division, a disunion
could not take place. If God is really a different being from myself,
why should his perfection trouble me? Disunion exists only between
beings who are at variance, but who ought to be one, who can be one,
and who consequently in nature, in truth, are one. On this general
ground, then, the nature with which man feels himself in disunion must
be inborn, immanent in himself, but at the same time it must be of a
different character from that nature or power which gives him the
feeling, the consciousness of reconciliation, of union with God, or,
what is the same thing, with himself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>This nature is nothing else than the intelligence&mdash;the reason
or the understanding. God as the antithesis of man, as a being not
human, <i>i.e.</i>, not personally human, is the objective nature of
the understanding. The pure, perfect divine nature is the
self-consciousness of the understanding, the consciousness which the
understanding has of its own perfection. The understanding knows
nothing of the sufferings of the heart; it has no desires, no passions,
no wants, and, for that reason, no deficiencies and weaknesses, as the
heart has. Men in whom the intellect predominates, who, with one-sided
but all the more characteristic definiteness, embody and personify for
us the nature of the understanding, are free from the anguish of the
heart, from the passions, the excesses of the man who has strong
emotions; they are not passionately interested in any finite,
<i>i.e.</i>, particular object; they do not give themselves in pledge;
they are free. &ldquo;To want nothing, and by this freedom from wants
to become like the immortal gods;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;not to subject
ourselves to things, but things to us;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;all is
vanity;&rdquo;&mdash;these and similar sayings are the mottoes of the
men who are governed by abstract understanding. The understanding is
that part of our nature which is neutral, impassible, not to bribed,
not subject to illusions&mdash;the pure, passionless light of the
intelligence. It is the categorical, impartial consciousness of the
fact as fact, because it is itself of an objective nature. It is the
consciousness of the uncontradictory, because it is itself the
uncontradictory unity, the source of logical identity. It is the
consciousness of law, necessity, rule, measure, because it is itself
the activity of law, the necessity of the nature of things under the
form of spontaneous activity, the rule of rules, the absolute measure,
the measure of measures. Only by the understanding can man judge and
act in contradiction with his dearest human, that is, personal
feelings, when the God of the understanding,&mdash;law, necessity,
right,&mdash;commands it. The father who, as a judge, condemns his own
son to death because he knows him to be guilty, can do this only as a
rational, not as an emotional being. The understanding shows us the
faults and weaknesses even of our beloved ones; it shows us even our
own. It is for this reason that it so often throws us into painful
collision with ourselves, with our own hearts. We do not like to give
reason the upper hand: we are too tender to ourselves to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>carry
out the true, but hard, relentless verdict of the understanding. The
understanding is the power which has relation to species: the heart
represents particular circumstances, individuals,&mdash;the
understanding, general circumstances, universals; it is the superhuman,
<i>i.e.</i>, the impersonal power in man. Only by and in the
understanding has man the power of abstraction from himself, from his
subjective being,&mdash;of exalting himself to general ideas and
relations, of distinguishing the object from the impressions which it
produces on his feelings, of regarding it in and by itself without
reference to human personality. Philosophy, mathematics, astronomy,
physics, in short, science in general, is the practical proof, because
it is the product of this truly infinite and divine activity. Religious
anthropomorphisms, therefore, are in contradiction with the
understanding; it repudiates their application to God; it denies them.
But this God, free from anthropomorphisms, impartial, passionless, is
nothing else than the nature of the understanding itself regarded as
objective.</p>
<p>God as God, that is, as a being not finite, not human, not
materially conditioned, not phenomenal, is only an object of thought.
He is the incorporeal, formless, incomprehensible&mdash;the abstract,
negative being: he is known, <i>i.e.</i>, becomes an object, only by
abstraction and negation (<i>vi&acirc; negationis</i>). Why? Because he
is nothing but the objective nature of the thinking power, or in
general of the power or activity, name it what you will, whereby man is
conscious of reason, of mind, of intelligence. There is no other
spirit, that is (for the idea of spirit is simply the idea of thought,
of intelligence, of understanding, every other spirit being a spectre
of the imagination), no other intelligence which man can believe in or
conceive than that intelligence which enlightens him, which is active
in him. He can do nothing more than separate the intelligence from the
limitations of his own individuality. The &ldquo;infinite
spirit,&rdquo; in distinction from the finite, is therefore nothing
else than the intelligence disengaged from the limits of individuality
and corporeality,&mdash;for individuality and corporeality are
inseparable,&mdash;intelligence posited in and by itself. God, said the
schoolmen, the Christian fathers, and long before them the heathen
philosophers,&mdash;God is immaterial essence, intelligence, spirit,
pure understanding. Of God as God no image can be made; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>but
canst thou frame an image of mind? Has mind a form? Is not its activity
the most inexplicable, the most incapable of representation? God is
incomprehensible; but knowest thou the nature of the intelligence? Hast
thou searched out the mysterious operation of thought, the hidden
nature of self-consciousness? Is not self-consciousness the enigma of
enigmas? Did not the old mystics, schoolmen, and fathers, long ago
compare the incomprehensibility of the divine nature with that of the
human intelligence, and thus, in truth, identify the nature of God with
the nature of man?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1619src" href=
"#xd21e1619" name="xd21e1619src">1</a> God as God&mdash;as a purely
thinkable being, an object of the intellect&mdash;is thus nothing else
than the reason in its utmost intensification become objective to
itself. It is asked what is the understanding or the reason? The answer
is found in the idea of God. Everything must express itself, reveal
itself, make itself objective, affirm itself. God is the reason
expressing, affirming itself as the highest existence. To the
imagination, the reason is the revelation of God; but to the reason,
God is the revelation of the reason; since what reason is, what it can
do, is first made objective in God. God is a need of the intelligence,
a necessary thought&mdash;the highest degree of the thinking power.
&ldquo;The reason cannot rest in sensuous things;&rdquo; it can find
contentment only when it penetrates to the highest, first necessary
being, which can be an object to the reason alone. Why? Because with
the conception of this being it first completes itself, because only in
the idea of the highest nature is the highest nature of reason
existent, the highest step of the thinking power attained: and it is a
general truth, that we feel a blank, a void, a want in ourselves, and
are consequently unhappy and unsatisfied, so long as we have not come
to the last degree of a power, to that <i lang="la">quo nihil majus
cogitari potest</i>,&mdash;so long as we cannot bring our inborn
capacity for this or that art, this or that science, to the utmost
proficiency. For only in the highest proficiency is art truly art; only
in its highest degree is thought truly thought, reason. Only when thy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>thought is God dost thou truly think, rigorously
speaking; for only God is the realised, consummate, exhausted thinking
power. Thus in conceiving God, man first conceives reason as it truly
is, though by means of the imagination he conceives this divine nature
as distinct from reason, because as a being affected by external things
he is accustomed always to distinguish the object from the conception
of it. And here he applies the same process to the conception of the
reason, thus for an existence in reason, in thought, substituting an
existence in space and time, from which he had, nevertheless,
previously abstracted it. God, as a metaphysical being, is the
intelligence satisfied in itself, or rather, conversely, the
intelligence, satisfied in itself, thinking itself as the absolute
being, is God as a metaphysical being. Hence all metaphysical
predicates of God are <i>real</i> predicates only when they are
recognised as belonging to thought, to intelligence, to the
understanding.</p>
<p>The understanding is that which conditionates and co-ordinates all
things, that which places all things in reciprocal dependence and
connection, because it is itself immediate and unconditioned; it
inquires for the cause of all things, because it has its own ground and
end in itself. Only that which itself is nothing deduced, nothing
derived, can deduce and construct, can regard all besides itself as
derived; just as only that which exists for its own sake can view and
treat other things as means and instruments. The understanding is thus
the original, primitive being. The understanding derives all things
from God as the first cause; it finds the world, without an intelligent
cause, given over to senseless, aimless chance; that is, it finds only
in itself, in its own nature, the efficient and the final cause of the
world&mdash;the existence of the world is only then clear and
comprehensible when it sees the explanation of that existence in the
source of all clear and intelligible ideas, <i>i.e.</i>, in itself. The
being that works with design towards certain ends, <i>i.e.</i>, with
understanding, is alone the being that to the understanding has
immediate certitude, self-evidence. Hence that which of itself has no
designs, no purpose, must have the cause of its existence in the design
of another, and that an intelligent being. And thus the understanding
posits its own nature as the causal, first, premundane
existence&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, being in rank the first but in time the
last, it makes itself the first in time also.</p>
<p>The understanding is to itself the criterion of all reality.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>That which is opposed to the understanding, that
which is self-contradictory, is nothing; that which contradicts reason
contradicts God. For example, it is a contradiction of reason to
connect with the idea of the highest reality the limitations of
definite time and place; and hence reason denies these of God as
contradicting his nature. The reason can only believe in a God who is
accordant with its own nature, in a God who is not beneath its own
dignity, who, on the contrary, is a realisation of its own nature:
<i>i.e.</i>, the reason believes only in itself, in the absolute
reality of its own nature. The reason is not dependent on God, but God
on the reason. Even in the age of miracles and faith in authority, the
understanding constitutes itself, at least formally, the criterion of
divinity. God is all and can do all, it was said, by virtue of his
omnipotence; but nevertheless he is nothing and he can do nothing which
contradicts himself, <i>i.e.</i>, reason. Even omnipotence cannot do
what is contrary to reason. Thus above the divine omnipotence stands
the higher power of reason; above the nature of God the nature of the
understanding, as the criterion of that which is to be affirmed and
denied of God, the criterion of the positive and negative. Canst thou
believe in a God who is an unreasonable and wicked being? No, indeed;
but why not? Because it is in contradiction with thy understanding to
accept a wicked and unreasonable being as divine. What then dost thou
affirm, what is an object to thee, in God? Thy own understanding. God
is thy highest idea, the supreme effort of thy understanding, thy
highest power of thought. God is the sum of all realities, <i>i.e.</i>,
the sum of all affirmations of the understanding. That which I
recognise in the understanding as essential I place in God as existent:
God <i>is</i> what the understanding thinks as the highest. But in what
I perceive to be essential is revealed the nature of my understanding,
is shown the power of my thinking faculty.</p>
<p>Thus the understanding is the <i>ens realissimum</i>, the most real
being of the old onto-theology. &ldquo;Fundamentally,&rdquo; says
onto-theology, &ldquo;we cannot conceive God otherwise than by
attributing to him without limit all the real qualities which we find
in ourselves.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1672src" href=
"#xd21e1672" name="xd21e1672src">2</a> Our positive, essential
qualities, our realities, are therefore the realities of God, but in us
they exist with, in God without, limits. But what then withdraws
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>the limits from the realities, what does away with
the limits? The understanding. What, according to this, is the nature
conceived without limits, but the nature of the understanding
releasing, abstracting itself from all limits? As thou thinkest God,
such is thy thought;&mdash;the measure of thy God is the measure of thy
understanding. If thou conceivest God as limited, thy understanding is
limited; if thou conceivest God as unlimited, thy understanding is
unlimited; If, for example, thou conceivest God as a corporeal being,
corporeality is the boundary, the limit of thy understanding; thou
canst conceive nothing without a body. If, on the contrary, thou
deniest corporeality of God, this is a corroboration and proof of the
freedom of thy understanding from the limitation of corporeality. In
the unlimited divine nature thou representest only thy unlimited
understanding. And when thou declarest this unlimited being the
ultimate essence, the highest being, thou sayest in reality nothing
else than this: the <i>&ecirc;tre supr&ecirc;me</i>, the highest being,
is the understanding.</p>
<p>The understanding is further the self-subsistent and independent
being. That which has no understanding is not self-subsistent, is
dependent. A man without understanding is a man without will. He who
has no understanding allows himself to be deceived, imposed upon, used
as an instrument by others. How shall he whose understanding is the
tool of another have an independent will? Only he who thinks is free
and independent. It is only by the understanding that man reduces the
things around and beneath him to mere means of his own existence. In
general, that only is self-subsistent and independent which is an end
to itself, an object to itself. That which is an end and object to
itself is for that very reason&mdash;in so far as it is an object to
itself&mdash;no longer a means and object for another being. To be
without understanding is, in one word, to exist for another,&mdash;to
be an object: to have understanding is to exist for oneself,&mdash;to
be a subject. But that which no longer exists for another, but for
itself, rejects all dependence on another being. It is true we, as
physical beings, depend on the beings external to us, even as to the
modifications of thought; but in so far as we think, in the activity of
the understanding as such, we are dependent on no other being. Activity
of thought is spontaneous activity. &ldquo;When I think, I am conscious
that my <i>ego</i> in me thinks, and not some other thing. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>I
conclude, therefore, that this thinking in me does not inhere in
another thing outside of me, but in myself, consequently that I am a
substance, <i>i.e.</i>, that I exist by myself, without being a
predicate of another being.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1690src"
href="#xd21e1690" name="xd21e1690src">3</a> Although we always need the
air, yet as natural philosophers we convert the air from an object of
our physical need into an object of the self-sufficing activity of
thought, <i>i.e.</i>, into a mere thing for us. In breathing I am the
object of the air, the air the subject; but when I make the air an
object of thought, of investigation, when I analyse it, I reverse this
relation,&mdash;I make myself the subject, the air an object. But that
which is the object of another being is dependent. Thus the plant is
dependent on air and light, that is, it is an object for air, and
light, not for itself. It is true that air and light are reciprocally
an object for the plant. Physical life in general is nothing else than
this perpetual interchange of the objective and subjective relation. We
consume the air and are consumed by it; we enjoy and are enjoyed. The
understanding alone enjoys all things without being itself enjoyed; it
is the self-enjoying, self-sufficing existence&mdash;the absolute
subject&mdash;the subject which cannot be reduced to the object of
another being, because it makes all things objects, predicates of
itself,&mdash;which comprehends all things in itself, because it is
itself not a thing, because it is free from all things.</p>
<p>That is dependent the possibility of whose existence lies out of
itself; that is independent which has the possibility of its existence
in itself. Life therefore involves the contradiction of an existence at
once dependent and independent,&mdash;the contradiction that its
possibility lies both in itself and out of itself. The understanding
alone is free from this and other contradictions of life; it is the
essence perfectly self-subsistent, perfectly at one with itself,
perfectly self-existent.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1699src" href=
"#xd21e1699" name="xd21e1699src">4</a> Thinking is existence in self;
life, as differenced from thought, existence out of self: life is to
give from oneself; thought is to take into oneself. Existence out of
self is the world; existence in self is God. To think is to be God.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>The act of thought, as such, is the freedom of the
immortal gods from all external limitations and necessities of
life.</p>
<p>The unity of the understanding is the unity of God. To the
understanding the consciousness of its unity and universality is
essential; the understanding is itself nothing else than the
consciousness of itself as absolute identity, <i>i.e.</i>, that which
is accordant with the understanding is to it an absolute, universally
valid, law; it is impossible to the understanding to think that what is
self-contradictory, false, irrational, can anywhere be true, and,
conversely, that what is true, rational, can anywhere be false and
irrational. &ldquo;There may be intelligent beings who are not like me,
and yet I am certain that there are no intelligent beings who know laws
and truths different from those which I recognise; for every mind
necessarily sees that two and two make four, and that one must prefer
one&rsquo;s friend to one&rsquo;s dog.<span class="corr" id="xd21e1709"
title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1711src" href="#xd21e1711" name="xd21e1711src">5</a> Of an
essentially different understanding from that which affirms itself in
man, I have not the remotest conception, the faintest adumbration. On
the contrary, every understanding which I posit as different from my
own, is only a position of my own understanding, <i>i.e.</i>, an idea
of my own, a conception which falls within my power of thought, and
thus expresses my understanding. What I think, that I myself do, of
course only in purely intellectual matters; what I think of as united,
I unite; what I think of as distinct, I distinguish; what I think of as
abolished, as negatived, that I myself abolish and negative. For
example, if I conceive an understanding in which the intuition or
reality of the object is immediately united with the thought of it, I
actually unite it; my understanding or my imagination is itself the
power of uniting these distinct or opposite ideas. How would it be
possible for me to conceive them united&mdash;whether this conception
be clear or confused&mdash;if I did not unite them in myself? But
whatever may be the conditions of the understanding which a given human
individual may suppose as distinguished from his own, this other
understanding is only the understanding which exists in man in
general&mdash;the understanding conceived apart from the limits of this
particular individual. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>Unity is involved in the idea of the
understanding. The impossibility for the understanding to think two
supreme beings, two infinite substances, two Gods, is the impossibility
for the understanding to contradict itself, to deny its own nature, to
think of itself as divided.</p>
<p>The understanding is the infinite being. Infinitude is immediately
involved in unity, and finiteness in plurality. Finiteness&mdash;in the
metaphysical sense&mdash;rests on the distinction of the existence from
the essence, of the individual from the species; infinitude, on the
unity of existence and essence. Hence, that is finite which can be
compared with other beings of the same species; that is infinite which
has nothing like itself, which consequently does not stand as an
individual under a species, but is species and individual in one,
essence and existence in one. But such is the understanding; it has its
essence in itself, consequently it has nothing, together with or
external to itself, which can be ranged beside it; it is incapable of
being compared, because it is itself the source of all combinations and
comparisons; immeasurable, because it is the measure of all
measures,&mdash;we measure all things by the understanding alone; it
can be circumscribed by no higher generalisation, it can be ranged
under no species, because it is itself the principle of all
generalising, of all classification, because it circumscribes all
things and beings. The definitions which the speculative philosophers
and theologians give of God, as the being in whom existence and essence
are not separable, who himself <i>is</i> all the attributes which he
<i>has</i>, so that predicate and subject are with him
identical,&mdash;all these definitions are thus ideas drawn solely from
the nature of the understanding.</p>
<p>Lastly, the understanding or the reason is the necessary being.
Reason exists because only the existence of the reason is reason;
because, if there were no reason, no consciousness, all would be
nothing; existence would be equivalent to non-existence. Consciousness
first founds the distinction between existence and non-existence. In
consciousness is first revealed the value of existence, the value of
nature. Why, in general, does something exist? why does the world
exist? on the simple ground that if something did not exist, nothing
would exist; if reason did not exist, there would be only unreason;
thus the world exists <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43"
name="pb43">43</a>]</span>because it is an absurdity that the world
should not exist. In the absurdity of its non-existence is found the
true reason of its existence, in the groundlessness of the supposition
that it were not the reason that it is. Nothing, non-existence, is
aimless, nonsensical, irrational. Existence alone has an aim, a
foundation, rationality; existence is, because only existence is reason
and truth; existence is the absolute necessity. What is the cause of
conscious existence, of life? The need of life. But to whom is it a
need? To that which does not live. It is not a being who saw that made
the eye: to one who saw already, to what purpose would be the eye? No!
only the being who saw not needed the eye. We are all come into the
world without the operation of knowledge and will; but we are come that
knowledge and will may exist. Whence, then, came the world? Out of
necessity; not out of a necessity which lies in another being distinct
from itself&mdash;that is a pure contradiction,&mdash;but out of its
own inherent necessity; out of the necessity of necessity; because
without the world there would be no necessity; without necessity, no
reason, no understanding. The nothing, out of which the world came, is
nothing without the world. It is true that thus, negativity, as the
speculative philosophers express themselves&mdash;<i>nothing</i> is the
cause of the world;&mdash;but a nothing which abolishes itself,
<i>i.e.</i>, a nothing which could not have existed if there had been
no world. It is true that the world springs out of a want, out of
privation, but it is false speculation to make this privation an
ontological being: this want is simply <i>the</i> want which lies in
the supposed non-existence of the world. Thus the world is only
necessary out of itself and through itself. But the necessity of the
world is the necessity of reason. The reason, as the sum of all
realities,&mdash;for what are all the glories of the world without
light, much more external light without internal light?&mdash;the
reason is the most indispensable being&mdash;the profoundest and most
essential necessity. In the reason first lies the self-consciousness of
existence, self-conscious existence; in the reason is first revealed
the end, the meaning of existence. Reason is existence objective to
itself as its own end; the ultimate tendency of things. That which is
an object to itself is the highest, the final being; that which has
power over itself is almighty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h2 class="main">GOD AS A MORAL BEING, OR LAW.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">God as God&mdash;the infinite, universal,
non-anthropomorphic being of the understanding, has no more
significance for religion than a fundamental general principle has for
a special science; it is merely the ultimate point of support,&mdash;as
it were, the mathematical point of religion. The consciousness of human
limitation or nothingness which is united with the idea of this being,
is by no means a religious consciousness; on the contrary, it
characterises sceptics, materialists, and pantheists. The belief in
God&mdash;at least in the God of religion&mdash;is only lost where, as
in scepticism, pantheism, and materialism, the belief in man is lost,
at least in man such as he is presupposed in religion. As little then
as religion has any influential belief in the nothingness of
man,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1752src" href="#xd21e1752" name=
"xd21e1752src">1</a> so little has it any influential belief in that
abstract being with which the consciousness of this nothingness is
united. The vital elements of religion are those only which make man an
object to man. To deny man is to deny religion.</p>
<p>It certainly is the interest of religion that its object should be
distinct from man; but it is also, nay, yet more, its interest that
this object should have human attributes. That he should be a distinct
being concerns his existence only; but that he should be human concerns
his essence. If he be of a different nature, how can his existence or
non-existence be of any importance to man? How can he take so profound
an interest in an existence in which his own nature has no
participation?</p>
<p>To give an example. &ldquo;When I believe that the human nature
alone has suffered for me, Christ is a poor Saviour to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>me: in
that case, he needs a Saviour himself.&rdquo; And thus, out of the need
for salvation is postulated something transcending human nature, a
being different from man. But no sooner is this being postulated than
there arises the yearning of man after himself, after his own nature,
and man is immediately re-established. &ldquo;Here is God, who is not
man and never yet became man. But this is not a God for me.... That
would be a miserable Christ to me, who ... should be nothing but a
purely separate God and divine person ... without humanity. No, my
friend; where thou givest me God, thou must give me humanity
too.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1761src" href="#xd21e1761" name=
"xd21e1761src">2</a></p>
<p>In religion man seeks contentment; religion is his highest good. But
how could he find consolation and peace in God if God were an
essentially different being? How can I share the peace of a being if I
am not of the same nature with him? If his nature is different from
mine, his peace is essentially different,&mdash;it is no peace for me.
How then can I become a partaker of his peace if I am not a partaker of
his nature? but how can I be a partaker of his nature if I am really of
a different nature? Every being experiences peace only in its own
element, only in the conditions of its own nature. Thus, if man feels
peace in God, he feels it only because in God he first attains his true
nature, because here, for the first time, he is with himself, because
everything in which he hitherto sought peace, and which he hitherto
mistook for his nature, was alien to him. Hence, if man is to find
contentment in God, he must find himself in God. &ldquo;No one will
taste of God but as he wills, namely&mdash;in the humanity of Christ;
and if thou dost not find God thus, thou wilt never have
rest.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1766src" href="#xd21e1766"
name="xd21e1766src">3</a> &ldquo;Everything finds rest on the place in
which it was born. The place where I was born is God. God is my
fatherland. Have I a father in God? Yes, I have not only a father, but
I have myself in him; before I lived in myself, I lived already in
God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1769src" href="#xd21e1769" name=
"xd21e1769src">4</a></p>
<p>A God, therefore, who expresses only the nature of the understanding
does not satisfy religion, is not the God of religion. The
understanding is interested not only in man, but in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>things
out of man, in universal nature. The intellectual man forgets even
himself in the contemplation of nature. The Christians scorned the
pagan philosophers because, instead of thinking of themselves, of their
own salvation, they had thought only of things out of themselves. The
Christian thinks only of himself. By the understanding an insect is
contemplated with as much enthusiasm as the image of God&mdash;man. The
understanding is the absolute indifference and identity of all things
and beings. It is not Christianity, not religious enthusiasm, but the
enthusiasm of the understanding that we have to thank for botany,
mineralogy, zoology, physics, and astronomy. The understanding is
universal, pantheistic, the love of the universe; but the grand
characteristic of religion, and of the Christian religion especially,
is that it is thoroughly anthropotheistic, the exclusive love of man
for himself, the exclusive self-affirmation of the human nature, that
is, of subjective human nature; for it is true that the understanding
also affirms the nature of man, but it is his objective nature, which
has reference to the object for the sake of the object, and the
manifestation of which is science. Hence it must be something entirely
different from the nature of the understanding which is an object to
man in religion, if he is to find contentment therein, and this
something will necessarily be the very kernel of religion.</p>
<p>Of all the attributes which the understanding assigns to God, that
which in religion, and especially in the Christian religion, has the
pre-eminence, is moral perfection. But God as a morally perfect being
is nothing else than the realised idea, the fulfilled law of morality,
the moral nature of man posited as the absolute being; man&rsquo;s own
nature, for the moral God requires man to be as he himself is: Be ye
holy for I am holy; man&rsquo;s own conscience, for how could he
otherwise tremble before the Divine Being, accuse himself before him,
and make him the judge of his inmost thoughts and feelings?</p>
<p>But the consciousness of the absolutely perfect moral nature,
especially as an abstract being separate from man, leaves us cold and
empty, because we feel the distance, the chasm between ourselves and
this being;&mdash;it is a dispiriting consciousness, for it is the
consciousness of our personal nothingness, and of the kind which is the
most acutely felt<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>&mdash;moral nothingness. The consciousness of the
divine omnipotence and eternity in opposition to my limitation in space
and time does not afflict me: for omnipotence does not command me to be
myself omnipotent, eternity, to be myself eternal. But I cannot have
the idea of moral perfection without at the same time being conscious
of it as a law for me. Moral perfection depends, at least for the moral
consciousness, not on the nature, but on the will&mdash;it is a
perfection of will, perfect will. I cannot conceive perfect will, the
will which is in unison with law, which is itself law, without at the
same time regarding it is an object of will, <i>i.e.</i>, as an
obligation for myself. The conception of the morally perfect being is
no merely theoretical, inert conception, but a practical one, calling
me to action, to imitation, throwing me into strife, into disunion with
myself; for while it proclaims to me what I ought to be, it also tells
me to my face, without any flattery, what I am not.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1785src" href="#xd21e1785" name="xd21e1785src">5</a> And
religion renders this disunion all the more painful, all the more
terrible, that it sets man&rsquo;s own nature before him as a separate
nature, and moreover as a personal being, who hates and curses sinners,
and excludes them from his grace, the source of all salvation and
happiness.</p>
<p>Now, by what means does man deliver himself from this state of
disunion between himself and the perfect being, from the painful
consciousness of sin, from the distressing sense of his own
nothingness? How does he blunt the fatal sting of sin? Only by this;
that he is conscious of <i>love</i> as the highest, the absolute power
and truth, that he regards the Divine Being not only as a law, as a
moral being, as a being of the understanding; but also as a loving,
tender, even subjective human being (that is, as having sympathy with
individual man).</p>
<p>The understanding judges only according to the stringency of law;
the heart accommodates itself, is considerate, lenient, relenting,
<span class="trans" title="kat&rsquo; anthr&#333;pon"><span class=
"Greek" lang="el">&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&rsquo;
&#7940;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&nu;</span></span>. No man
is sufficient for the law which moral perfection sets before us; but,
for that reason, neither is the law sufficient for man, for the heart.
The law condemns; the heart has compassion even on the sinner. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>law affirms me only as an abstract
being,&mdash;love, as a real being. Love gives me the consciousness
that I am a man; the law only the consciousness that I am a sinner,
that I am worthless.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1805src" href=
"#xd21e1805" name="xd21e1805src">6</a> The law holds man in bondage;
love makes him free.</p>
<p>Love is the middle term, the substantial bond, the principle of
reconciliation between the perfect and the imperfect, the sinless and
sinful being, the universal and the individual, the divine and the
human. Love is God himself, and apart from it there is no God. Love
makes man God and God man. Love strengthens the weak and weakens the
strong, abases the high and raises the lowly, idealises matter and
materialises spirit. Love <span class="corr" id="xd21e1814" title=
"Source: it">is</span> the true unity of God and man, of spirit and
nature. In love common nature is spirit, and the pre-eminent spirit is
nature. Love is to deny spirit from the point of view of spirit, to
deny matter from the point of view of matter. Love is materialism;
immaterial love is a chim&aelig;ra. In the longing of love after the
distant object, the abstract idealist involuntarily confirms the truth
of sensuousness. But love is also the idealism of nature&mdash;love is
also spirit, <i>esprit</i>. Love alone makes the nightingale a
songstress; love alone gives the plant its corolla. And what wonders
does not love work in our social life! What faith, creed, opinion
separates, love unites. Love even, humorously enough, identifies the
high noblesse with the people. What the old mystics said of God, that
he is the highest and yet the commonest being, applies in truth to
love, and that not a visionary, imaginary love&mdash;no! a real love, a
love which has flesh and blood, which vibrates as an almighty force
through all living.</p>
<p>Yes, it applies only to the love which has flesh and blood, for only
this can absolve from the sins which flesh and blood commit. A merely
moral being cannot forgive what is contrary to the law of morality.
That which denies the law is denied by the law. The moral judge, who
does not infuse human blood into his judgment judges the sinner
relentlessly, inexorably. Since, then, God is regarded as a
sin-pardoning being, he is posited, not indeed as an unmoral, but as
more than a moral being&mdash;in a word, as a human <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>being.
The negation or annulling of sin is the negation of abstract moral
rectitude,&mdash;the positing of love, mercy, sensuous life. Not
abstract beings&mdash;no! only sensuous, living beings are merciful.
Mercy is the <i>justice of sensuous life</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1827src" href="#xd21e1827" name="xd21e1827src">7</a> Hence God
does not forgive the sins of men as the abstract God of the
understanding, but as man, as the God made flesh, the visible God. God
as man sins not, it is true, but he knows, he takes on himself, the
sufferings, the wants, the needs of sensuous beings. The blood of
Christ cleanses us from our sins in the eyes of God; it is only his
human blood that makes God merciful, allays his anger; that is, our
sins are forgiven us because we are no abstract beings, but creatures
of flesh and blood.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1830src" href=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY OF THE INCARNATION; OR, GOD AS LOVE, AS A
BEING OF THE HEART.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is the consciousness of love by which man
reconciles himself with God, or rather with his own nature as
represented in the moral law. The consciousness of the divine love, or
what is the same thing, the contemplation of God as human, is the
mystery of the Incarnation. The Incarnation is nothing else than the
practical, material manifestation of the human nature of God. God did
not become man for his own sake; the need, the want of man&mdash;a want
which still exists in the religious sentiment&mdash;was the cause of
the Incarnation. God became man out of mercy: thus he was in himself
already a human God before he became an actual man; for human want,
human misery, went to his heart. The Incarnation was a tear of the
divine compassion, and hence it was only the visible advent of a Being
having human feelings, and therefore essentially human.</p>
<p>If in the Incarnation we stop short at the fact of God becoming man,
it certainly appears a surprising, inexplicable, marvellous event. But
the incarnate God is only the apparent manifestation of deified man;
for the descent of God to man is necessarily preceded by the exaltation
of man to God. Man was already in God, was already God himself, before
God became man, <i>i.e.</i>, showed himself as man.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1850src" href="#xd21e1850" name="xd21e1850src">1</a> How
otherwise could God have become man? The old maxim, <i>ex nihilo nihil
fit,</i> is applicable here also. A king who has not the welfare of his
subjects at heart, who, while seated on his throne, does not mentally
live with them in their dwellings, who, in feeling, is not, as the
people say, &ldquo;a common man,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>such a king will not
descend bodily from his throne to make his people happy by his personal
presence. Thus, has not the subject risen to be a king before the king
descends to be a subject? And if the subject feels himself honoured and
made happy by the personal presence of his king, does this feeling
refer merely to the bodily presence, and not rather to the
manifestation of the disposition, of the philanthropic nature which is
the cause of the appearance? But that which in the truth of religion is
the cause, takes in the consciousness of religion the form of a
consequence; and so here the raising of man to God is made a
consequence of the humiliation or descent of God to man. God, says
religion, made himself human that he might make man divine.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1858src" href="#xd21e1858" name=
"xd21e1858src">2</a></p>
<p>That which is mysterious and incomprehensible, <i>i.e.</i>,
contradictory, in the proposition, &ldquo;God is or becomes a
man,&rdquo; arises only from the mingling or confusion of the idea or
definitions of the universal, unlimited, metaphysical being with the
idea of the religious God, <i>i.e.</i>, the conditions of the
understanding with the conditions of the heart, the emotive nature; a
confusion which is the greatest hindrance to the correct knowledge of
religion. But, in fact, the idea of the Incarnation is nothing more
than the human <i>form</i> of a God, who already in his nature, in the
profoundest depths of his soul, is a merciful and therefore a human
God.</p>
<p>The form given to this truth in the doctrine of the Church is, that
it was not the first person of the Godhead who was incarnate, but the
second, who is the representative of man in and before God; the second
person being however in reality, as will be shown, the sole, true,
first person in religion. And it is only apart from this distinction of
persons that the God-man appears mysterious, incomprehensible,
&ldquo;speculative;&rdquo; for, considered in connection with it, the
Incarnation is a necessary, nay, a self-evident consequence. The
allegation, therefore, that the Incarnation is a purely empirical fact,
which could be made known only by means of a revelation in the
theological sense, betrays the most crass religious materialism; for
the Incarnation is a conclusion which rests <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>on a
very comprehensible premiss. But it is equally perverse to attempt to
deduce the Incarnation from purely speculative, <i>i.e.</i>,
metaphysical, abstract grounds; for metaphysics apply only to the first
person of the Godhead, who does not become incarnate, who is not a
dramatic person. Such a deduction would at the utmost be justifiable if
it were meant consciously to deduce from metaphysics the negation of
metaphysics.</p>
<p>This example clearly exhibits the distinction between the method of
our philosophy and that of the old speculative philosophy. The former
does not philosophise concerning the Incarnation, as a peculiar,
stupendous mystery, after the manner of speculation dazzled by mystical
splendour; on the contrary, it destroys the illusive supposition of a
peculiar supernatural mystery; it criticises the dogma and reduces it
to its natural elements, immanent in man, to its originating principle
and central point&mdash;love.</p>
<p>The dogma presents to us two things&mdash;God and love. God is love:
but what does that mean? Is God something besides love? a being
distinct from love? Is it as if I said of an affectionate human being,
he is love itself? Certainly; otherwise I must give up the name God,
which expresses a special personal being, a subject in distinction from
the predicate. Thus love is made something apart. God out of love sent
his only-begotten Son. Here love recedes and sinks into insignificance
in the dark background&mdash;God. It becomes merely a personal, though
an essential, attribute; hence it receives both in theory and in
feeling, both objectively and subjectively, the rank simply of a
predicate, not that of a subject, of the substance; it shrinks out of
observation as a collateral, an accident; at one moment it presents
itself to me as something essential, at another, it vanishes again. God
appears to me in another form besides that of love; in the form of
omnipotence, of a severe power not bound by love; a power in which,
though in a smaller degree, the devils participate.</p>
<p>So long as love is not exalted into a substance, into an essence, so
long there lurks in the background of love a subject who even without
love is something by himself, an unloving monster, a diabolical being,
whose personality, separable and actually separated from love, delights
in the blood of heretics and unbelievers,&mdash;the phantom of
religious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>fanaticism. Nevertheless the essential idea of the
Incarnation, though enveloped in the night of the religious
consciousness, is love. Love determined God to the renunciation of his
divinity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1887src" href="#xd21e1887" name=
"xd21e1887src">3</a> Not because of his Godhead as such, according to
which he is the <i>subject</i> in the proposition, God is love, but
because of his love, of the <i>predicate</i>, is it that he renounced
his Godhead; thus love is a higher power and truth than deity. Love
conquers God. It was love to which God sacrificed his divine majesty.
And what sort of love was that? another than ours? than that to which
we sacrifice life and fortune? Was it the love of himself? of himself
as God? No! it was love to man. But is not love to man human love? Can
I love man without loving him humanly, without loving him as he himself
loves, if he truly loves? Would not love be otherwise a devilish love?
The devil too loves man, but not for man&rsquo;s sake&mdash;for his
own; thus he loves man out of egotism, to aggrandise himself, to extend
his power. But God loves man for man&rsquo;s sake, <i>i.e.</i>, that he
may make him good, happy, blessed. Does he not then love man as the
true man loves his fellow? Has love a plural? Is it not everywhere like
itself? What then is the true unfalsified import of the Incarnation but
absolute, pure love, without adjunct, without a distinction between
divine and human love? For though there is also a self-interested love
among men, still the true human love, which is alone worthy of this
name, is that which impels the sacrifice of self to another. Who then
is our Saviour and Redeemer? God or Love? Love; for God as God has not
saved us, but Love, which transcends the difference between the divine
and human personality. As God has renounced himself out of love, so we,
out of love, should renounce God; for if we do not sacrifice God to
love, we sacrifice love to God, and, in spite of the predicate of love,
we have the God&mdash;the evil being&mdash;of religious fanaticism.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>While, however, we have laid open this nucleus of truth in the
Incarnation, we have at the same time exhibited the dogma in its
falsity; we have reduced the apparently supernatural and super-rational
mystery to a simple truth inherent in human nature:&mdash;a truth which
does not belong to the Christian religion alone, but which, implicitly
at least, belongs more or less to every religion as such. For every
religion which has any claim to the name presupposes that God is not
indifferent to the beings who worship him, that therefore what is human
is not alien to him, that, as an object of human veneration, he is a
human God. Every prayer discloses the secret of the Incarnation, every
prayer is in fact an incarnation of God. In prayer I involve God in
human distress, I make him a participator in my sorrows and wants. God
is not deaf to my complaints; he has compassion on me; hence he
renounces his divine majesty, his exaltation above all that is finite
and human; he becomes a man with man; for if he listens to me, and
pities me, he is affected by my sufferings. God loves
man&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, God suffers from man. Love does not exist
without sympathy, sympathy does not exist without suffering in common.
Have I any sympathy for a being without feeling? No! I feel only for
that which has feeling, only for that which partakes of my nature, for
that in which I feel myself, whose sufferings I myself suffer. Sympathy
presupposes a like nature. The Incarnation, Providence, prayer, are the
expression of this identity of nature in God and man.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1909src" href="#xd21e1909" name="xd21e1909src">4</a></p>
<p>It is true that theology, which is pre-occupied with the
metaphysical attributes of eternity, unconditionedness,
unchangeableness, and the like abstractions, which express the nature
of the understanding,&mdash;theology denies the possibility that God
should suffer, but in so doing it denies the truth of
religion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1914src" href="#xd21e1914" name=
"xd21e1914src">5</a> For religion&mdash;the religious man in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>act of devotion believes in a real sympathy of the
divine being in his sufferings and wants, believes that the will of God
can be determined by the fervour of prayer, <i>i.e.</i>, by the force
of feeling, believes in a real, present fulfilment of his desire,
wrought by prayer. The truly religious man unhesitatingly assigns his
own feelings to God; God is to him a heart susceptible to all that is
human. The heart can betake itself only to the heart; feeling can
appeal only to feeling; it finds consolation in itself, in its own
nature alone.</p>
<p>The notion that the fulfilment of prayer has been determined from
eternity, that it was originally included in the plan of creation, is
the empty, absurd fiction of a mechanical mode of thought, which is in
absolute contradiction with the nature of religion. &ldquo;We
need,&rdquo; says Lavater somewhere, and quite correctly according to
the religious sentiment, &ldquo;an arbitrary God.&rdquo; Besides, even
according to this fiction, God is just as much a being determined by
man, as in the real, present fulfilment consequent on the power of
prayer; the only difference is, that the contradiction with the
unchangeableness and unconditionedness of God&mdash;that which
constitutes the difficulty&mdash;is thrown back into the deceptive
distance of the past or of eternity. Whether God decides on the
fulfilment of my prayer now, on the immediate occasion of my offering
it, or whether he did decide on it long ago, is fundamentally the same
thing.</p>
<p>It is the greatest inconsequence to reject the idea of a God who can
be determined by prayer, that is, by the force of feeling, as an
unworthy anthropomorphic idea. If we once believe in a being who is an
object of veneration, an object of prayer, an object of affection, who
is providential, who takes care of man,&mdash;in a Providence, which is
not conceivable without love,&mdash;in a being, therefore, who is
loving, whose motive of action is love; we also believe in a being, who
has, if not an anatomical, yet a psychical human heart. The religious
mind, as has been said, places everything in God, excepting that alone
which it despises. The Christians certainly gave their God no
attributes which contradicted their own moral ideas, but they gave him
without hesitation, and of necessity, the emotions of love, of
compassion. And the love which the religious mind places in God is not
an illusory, imaginary love, but a real, true love. God is loved and
loves again; the divine love is only human love <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>made
objective, affirming itself. In God love is absorbed in itself as its
own ultimate truth.</p>
<p>It may be objected to the import here assigned to the Incarnation,
that the Christian Incarnation is altogether peculiar, that at least it
is different (which is quite true in certain respects, as will
hereafter be apparent) from the incarnations of the heathen deities,
whether Greek or Indian. These latter are mere products of men or
deified men; but in Christianity is given the idea of the true God;
here the union of the divine nature with the human is first significant
and &ldquo;speculative.&rdquo; Jupiter transforms himself into a bull;
the heathen incarnations are mere fancies. In paganism there is no more
in the nature of God than in his incarnate manifestation; in
Christianity, on the contrary, it is God, a separate, superhuman being,
who appears as man. But this objection is refuted by the remark already
made, that even the premiss of the Christian Incarnation contains the
human nature. God loves man; moreover God has a Son; God is a father;
the relations of humanity are not excluded from God; the human is not
remote from God, not unknown to him. Thus here also there is nothing
more in the nature of God than in the incarnate manifestation of God.
In the Incarnation religion only confesses, what in reflection on
itself, as theology, it will not admit; namely, that God is an
altogether human being. The Incarnation, the mystery of the
&ldquo;God-man,&rdquo; is therefore no mysterious composition of
contraries, no synthetic fact, as it is regarded by the speculative
religious philosophy, which has a particular delight in contradiction;
it is an analytic fact,&mdash;a human word with a human meaning. If
there be a contradiction here, it lies before the incarnation and out
of it; in the union of providence, of love, with deity; for if this
love is a real love, it is not essentially different from our
love,&mdash;there are only our limitations to be abstracted from it;
and thus the Incarnation is only the strongest, deepest, most palpable,
open-hearted expression of this providence, this love. Love knows not
how to make its object happier than by rejoicing it with its personal
presence, by letting itself be seen. To see the invisible benefactor
face to face is the most ardent desire of love. To see is a divine act.
Happiness lies in the mere sight of the beloved one. The glance is the
certainty of love. And <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span>the Incarnation has no other significance, no
other effect, than the indubitable certitude of the love of God to man.
Love remains, but the Incarnation upon the earth passes away: the
appearance was limited by time and place, accessible to few; but the
essence, the nature which was manifested, is eternal and universal. We
can no longer believe in the manifestation for its own sake, but only
for the sake of the thing manifested; for to us there remains no
immediate presence but that of love.</p>
<p>The clearest, most irrefragable proof that man in religion
contemplates himself as the object of the Divine Being, as the end of
the divine activity, that thus in religion he has relation only to his
own nature, only to himself,&mdash;the clearest, most irrefragable
proof of this is the love of God to man, the basis and central point of
religion. God, for the sake of man, empties himself of his Godhead,
lays aside his Godhead. Herein lies the elevating influence of the
Incarnation; the highest, the perfect being humiliates, lowers himself
for the sake of man. Hence in God I learn to estimate my own nature; I
have value in the sight of God; the divine significance of my nature is
become evident to me. How can the worth of man be more strongly
expressed than when God, for man&rsquo;s sake, becomes a man, when man
is the end, the object of the divine love? The love of God to man is an
essential condition of the Divine Being: God is a God who loves
me&mdash;who loves man in general. Here lies the emphasis, the
fundamental feeling of religion. The love of God makes me loving; the
love of God to man is the cause of man&rsquo;s love to God; the divine
love causes, awakens human love. &ldquo;We love God because he first
loved us.&rdquo; What, then, is it that I love in God? Love: love to
man. But when I love and worship the love with which God loves man, do
I not love man; is not my love of God, though indirectly, love of man?
If God loves man, is not man, then, the very substance of God? That
which I love, is it not my inmost being? Have I a heart when I do not
love? No! love only is the heart of man. But what is love without the
thing loved? Thus what I love is my heart, the substance of my being,
my nature. Why does man grieve, why does he lose pleasure in life when
he has lost the beloved object? Why? because with the beloved object he
has lost his heart, the activity of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>affections, the principle
of life. Thus if God loves man, man is the heart of God&mdash;the
welfare of man his deepest anxiety. If man, then, is the object of God,
is not man, in God, an object to himself? is not the content of the
divine nature the human nature? If God is love, is not the essential
content of this love man? Is not the love of God to man&mdash;the basis
and central point of religion&mdash;the love of man to himself made an
object, contemplated as the highest objective truth, as the highest
being to man? Is not then the proposition, &ldquo;God loves man&rdquo;
an orientalism (religion is essentially oriental), which in plain
speech means, the highest is the love of man?</p>
<p>The truth to which, by means of analysis, we have here reduced the
mystery of the Incarnation, has also been recognised even in the
religious consciousness. Thus Luther, for example, says, &ldquo;He who
can truly conceive such a thing (namely, the incarnation of God) in his
heart, should, for the sake of the flesh and blood which sits at the
right hand of God, bear love to all flesh and blood here upon the
earth, and never more be able to be angry with any man. The gentle
manhood of Christ our God should at a glance fill all hearts with joy,
so that never more could an angry, unfriendly thought come
therein&mdash;yea, every man ought, out of great joy, to be tender to
his fellow-man for the sake of that our flesh and blood.&rdquo;
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1947" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>This is a fact which should move us to
great joy and blissful hope that we are thus honoured above all
creatures, even above the angels, so that we can with truth boast, My
own flesh and blood sits at the right hand of God and reigns over all.
Such honour has no creature, not even an angel. This ought to be a
furnace that should melt us all into one heart, and should create such
a fervour in us men that we should heartily love each other.&rdquo; But
that which in the truth of religion is the essence of the fable, the
chief thing, is to the religious consciousness only the moral of the
fable, a collateral thing. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=

Luther, however (Th. i. p. 334), there is a passage which indicates the
true relation. When Moses called man &ldquo;the image of God, the
likeness of God,&rdquo; he meant, says Luther, obscurely to intimate
that &ldquo;God was to become man.&rdquo; Thus here the incarnation of

the Incarnation. &ldquo;Amor triumphat de Deo,&rdquo; says St. Bernard.
And only in the sense of a real self-renunciation, self-negation of the
Godhead, lies the reality, the <i>vis</i> of the Incarnation; although
this self-negation is in itself merely a conception of the imagination,
for, looked at in broad daylight, God does not negative himself in the
Incarnation, but he shows himself as that which he is, as a human
being. The fabrications which modern rationalistic orthodoxy and
pietistic rationalism have advanced concerning the Incarnation, in
opposition to the rapturous conceptions and expressions of ancient

<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY OF THE SUFFERING GOD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An essential condition of the incarnate, or, what is
the same thing, the human God, namely, Christ, is the Passion. Love
attests itself by suffering. All thoughts and feelings which are
immediately associated with Christ concentrate themselves in the idea
of the Passion. God as God is the sum of all human perfection; God as
Christ is the sum of all human misery. The heathen philosophers
celebrated activity, especially the spontaneous activity of the
intelligence, as the highest, the divine; the Christians consecrated
passivity, even placing it in God. If God as <i lang="la">actus
purus</i>, as pure activity, is the God of abstract philosophy; so, on
the other hand, Christ, the God of the Christians, is the <i>passio
pura</i>, pure suffering&mdash;the highest metaphysical thought, the
<i lang="fr">&ecirc;tre supr&ecirc;me</i> of the heart. For what makes
more impression on the heart than suffering? especially the suffering
of one who considered in himself is free from suffering, exalted above
it;&mdash;the suffering of the innocent, endured purely for the good of
others, the suffering of love,&mdash;self-sacrifice? But for the very
reason that the history of the Passion is the history which most deeply
affects the human heart, or let us rather say the heart in
general&mdash;for it would be a ludicrous mistake in man to attempt to
conceive any other heart than the human,&mdash;it follows undeniably
that nothing else is expressed in that history, nothing else is made an
object in it, but the nature of the heart,&mdash;that it is not an
invention of the understanding or the poetic faculty, but of the heart.
The heart, however, does not invent in the same way as the free
imagination or intelligence; it has a passive, receptive relation to
what it produces; all that proceeds from it seems to it given from
without, takes it by violence, works with the force of irresistible
necessity. The heart overcomes, masters man; he who is once in its
power is possessed as it were by his demon, by his God. The heart knows
no other God, no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>more excellent being than itself, than a God whose
name may indeed be another, but whose nature, whose substance is the
nature of the heart. And out of the heart, out of the inward impulse to
do good, to live and die for man, out of the divine instinct of
benevolence which desires to make all happy, and excludes none, not
even the most abandoned and abject, out of the moral duty of
benevolence in the highest sense, as having become an inward necessity,
<i>i.e.</i>, a movement of the heart,&mdash;out of the human nature,
therefore, as it reveals itself through the heart, has sprung what is
best, what is true in Christianity&mdash;its essence purified from
theological dogmas and contradictions.</p>
<p>For, according to the principles which we have already developed,
that which in religion is the predicate we must make the subject, and
that which in religion is a subject we must make a predicate, thus
inverting the oracles of religion; and by this means we arrive at the
truth. God suffers&mdash;suffering is the predicate&mdash;but for men,
for others, not for himself. What does that mean in plain speech?
Nothing else than this: to suffer for others is divine; he who suffers
for others, who lays down his life for them, acts divinely, is a God to
men.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1975src" href="#xd21e1975" name=
"xd21e1975src">1</a></p>
<p>The Passion of Christ, however, represents not only moral, voluntary
suffering, the suffering of love, the power of sacrificing self for the
good of others; it represents also suffering as such, suffering in so
far as it is an expression of passibility in general. The Christian
religion is so little superhuman that it even sanctions human weakness.
The heathen philosopher, on hearing tidings of the death of his child
exclaims: &ldquo;I knew that he was mortal.&rdquo; Christ, on the
contrary,&mdash;at least in the Bible,&mdash;sheds tears over the death
of Lazarus, a death which he nevertheless knew to be only an apparent
one. While Socrates empties the cup of poison with unshaken soul,
Christ exclaims, &ldquo;If it be possible, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>let this
cup pass from me.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1988src" href=
"#xd21e1988" name="xd21e1988src">2</a> Christ is in this respect the
self-confession of human sensibility. In opposition to the heathen, and
in particular the stoical principle, with its rigorous energy of will
and self-sustainedness, the Christian involves the consciousness of his
own sensitiveness and susceptibility in the consciousness of God; he
finds it, if only it be no sinful weakness, not denied, not condemned
in God.</p>
<p>To suffer is the highest command of Christianity&mdash;the history
of Christianity is the history of the Passion of Humanity. While
amongst the heathens the shout of sensual pleasure mingled itself in
the worship of the gods, amongst the Christians, we mean of course the
ancient Christians, God is served with sighs and tears.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1993src" href="#xd21e1993" name="xd21e1993src">3</a>
But as where sounds of sensual pleasure make a part of the cultus, it
is a sensual God, a God of life, who is worshipped, as indeed these
shouts of joy are only a symbolical definition of the nature of the
gods to whom this jubilation is acceptable; so also the sighs of
Christians are tones which proceed from the inmost soul, the inmost
nature of their God. The God expressed by the cultus, whether this be
an external, or, as with the Christians, an inward spiritual
worship,&mdash;not the God of sophistical theology,&mdash;is the true
God of man. But the Christians, we mean of course the ancient
Christians, believed that they rendered the highest honour to their God
by tears, the tears of repentance and yearning. Thus tears are the
light-reflecting drops which mirror the nature of the Christian&rsquo;s
God. But a God who has pleasure in tears, expresses nothing else than
the nature of the heart. It is true that the theory of the Christian
religion says: Christ has done all for us, has redeemed us, has
reconciled us with God; and from hence the inference may be drawn: Let
us be of a joyful mind and disposition; what need have we to trouble
ourselves as to how we shall reconcile ourselves with God? we are
reconciled already. But the imperfect tense in which the fact of
suffering is expressed makes a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>deeper, a more enduring
impression, than the perfect tense which expresses the fact of
redemption. The redemption is only the result of the suffering; the
suffering is the cause of the redemption. Hence the suffering takes
deeper root in the feelings; the suffering makes itself an object of
imitation;&mdash;not so the redemption. If God himself suffered for my
sake, how can I be joyful, how can I allow myself any gladness, at
least on this corrupt earth, which was the theatre of his
suffering?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1998src" href="#xd21e1998" name=
"xd21e1998src">4</a> Ought I to fare better than God? Ought I not,
then, to make his sufferings my own? Is not what God my Lord does my
model? Or shall I share only the gain and not the cost also? Do I know
merely that he has redeemed me? Do I not also know the history of his
suffering? Should it be an object of cold remembrance to me, or even an
object of rejoicing, because it has purchased my salvation? Who can
think so&mdash;who can wish to be exempt from the sufferings of his
God?</p>
<p>The Christian religion is the religion of suffering.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2012src" href="#xd21e2012" name="xd21e2012src">5</a>
The images of the crucified one which we still meet with in all
churches, represent not the Saviour, but only the crucified, the
suffering Christ. Even the self-crucifixions among the Christians are,
psychologically, a deep-rooted consequence of their religious views.
How should not he who has always the image of the crucified one in his
mind, at length contract the desire to crucify either himself or
another? At least we have as good a warrant for this conclusion as
Augustine and other fathers of the Church for their reproach against
the heathen religion, that the licentious religious images of the
heathens provoked and authorised licentiousness.</p>
<p>God suffers, means in truth nothing else than: God is a heart. The
heart is the source, the centre of all suffering. A being without
suffering is a being without a heart. The mystery of the suffering God
is therefore the mystery of feeling, sensibility. A suffering God is a
feeling, sensitive God.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2017src" href=
"#xd21e2017" name="xd21e2017src">6</a> But the proposition: God is a
feeling Being, is only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"
name="pb63">63</a>]</span>the religious periphrase of the proposition:
feeling is absolute, divine in its nature.</p>
<p>Man has the consciousness not only of a spring of activity, but also
of a spring of suffering in himself. I feel; and I feel feeling (not
merely will and thought, which are only too often in opposition to me
and my feelings), as belonging to my essential being, and, though the
source of all sufferings and sorrows, as a glorious, divine power and
perfection. What would man be without feeling? It is the musical power
in man. But what would man be without music? Just as man has a musical
faculty and feels an inward necessity to breathe out his feelings in
song; so, by a like necessity, he in religious sighs and tears streams
forth the nature of feeling as an objective, divine nature.</p>
<p>Religion is human nature reflected, mirrored in itself. That which
exists has necessarily a pleasure, a joy in itself, loves itself, and
loves itself justly; to blame it because it loves itself is to reproach
it because it exists. To exist is to assert oneself, to affirm oneself,
to love oneself; he to whom life is a burthen rids himself of it.
Where, therefore, feeling is not depreciated and repressed, as with the
Stoics, where existence is awarded to it, there also is religious power
and significance already conceded to it, there also is it already
exalted to that stage in which it can mirror and reflect itself, in
which it can project its own image as God. God is the mirror of
man.</p>
<p>That which has essential value for man, which he esteems the
perfect, the excellent, in which he has true delight,&mdash;that alone
is God to him. If feeling seems to thee a glorious attribute, it is
then, <i>per se</i>, a divine attribute to thee. Therefore, the
feeling, sensitive man believes only in a feeling, sensitive God,
<i>i.e.</i>, he believes only in the truth of his own existence and
nature, for he can believe in nothing else than that which is involved
in his own nature. His faith is the consciousness of that which is holy
to him; but that alone is holy to man which lies deepest within him,
which is most peculiarly his own, the basis, the essence of his
individuality. To the feeling man a God without feeling is an empty,
abstract, negative God, <i>i.e.</i>, nothing; because that is wanting
to him which is precious and sacred to man. God is for man the
commonplace book where he registers his highest feelings and thoughts,
the genealogical tree on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>which are entered the names that are
dearest and most sacred to him.</p>
<p>It is a sign of an undiscriminating good-nature, a womanish
instinct, to gather together and then to preserve tenaciously all that
we have gathered, not to trust anything to the waves of forgetfulness,
to the chance of memory, in short not to trust ourselves and learn to
know what really has value for us. The freethinker is liable to the
danger of an unregulated, dissolute life. The religious man who binds
together all things in one, does not lose himself in sensuality; but
for that reason he is exposed to the danger of illiberality, of
spiritual selfishness and greed. Therefore, to the religious man at
least, the irreligious or un-religious man appears lawless, arbitrary,
haughty, frivolous; not because that which is sacred to the former is
not also in itself sacred to the latter, but only because that which
the un-religious man holds in his head merely, the religious man places
out of and above himself as an object, and hence recognises in himself
the relation of a formal subordination. The religious man having a
commonplace book, a nucleus of aggregation, has an aim, and having an
aim he has firm standing-ground. Not mere will as such, not vague
knowledge&mdash;only activity with a purpose, which is the union of
theoretic and practical activity, gives man a moral basis and support,
<i>i.e.</i>, character. Every man, therefore, must place before himself
a God, <i>i.e.</i>, an aim, a purpose. The aim is the conscious,
voluntary, essential impulse of life, the glance of genius, the focus
of self-knowledge,&mdash;the unity of the material and spiritual in the
individual man. He who has an aim has a law over him; he does not
merely guide himself; he is guided. He who has no aim, has no home, no
sanctuary; aimlessness is the greatest unhappiness. Even he who has
only common aims gets on better, though he may not be better, than he
who has no aim. An aim sets limits; but limits are the mentors of
virtue. He who has an aim, an aim which is in itself true and
essential, has, <i lang="la">eo ipso</i>, a religion, if not in the
narrow sense of common pietism, yet&mdash;and this is the only point to
be considered&mdash;in the sense of reason, in the sense of the
universal, the only true love. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65"

<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY OF THE TRINITY AND THE MOTHER OF GOD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If a God without feeling, without a capability of
suffering, will not suffice to man as a feeling, suffering being,
neither will a God with feeling only, a God without intelligence and
will. Only a being who comprises in himself the whole man can satisfy
the whole man. Man&rsquo;s consciousness of himself in his totality is
the consciousness of the Trinity. The Trinity knits together the
qualities or powers which were before regarded separately into unity,
and thereby reduces the universal being of the understanding,
<i>i.e.</i>, God as God, to a special being, a special faculty.</p>
<p>That which theology designates as the image, the similitude of the
Trinity, we must take as the thing itself, the essence, the archetype,
the original; by this means we shall solve the enigma. The so-called
images by which it has been sought to illustrate the Trinity, and make
it comprehensible, are principally: mind, understanding, memory, will,
love&mdash;<i lang="la">mens</i>, <i lang="la">intellectus</i>,
<i lang="la">memoria</i>, <i lang="la">voluntas</i>, <i lang=
"la">amor</i> or <i lang="la">caritas</i>.</p>
<p>God thinks, God loves; and, moreover, he thinks, he loves himself;
the object thought, known, loved, is God himself. The objectivity of
self-consciousness is the first thing we meet with in the Trinity.
Self-consciousness necessarily urges itself upon man as something
absolute. Existence is for him one with self-consciousness; existence
with self-consciousness is for him existence simply. If I do not know
that I exist, it is all one whether I exist or not. Self-consciousness
is for man&mdash;is, in fact, in itself&mdash;absolute. A God who knows
not his own existence, a God without consciousness, is no God. Man
cannot conceive himself as without consciousness; hence he cannot
conceive God as without it. The divine self-consciousness is nothing
else than the consciousness of consciousness as an absolute or divine
essence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p>But this explanation is by no means exhaustive. On the contrary, we
should be proceeding very arbitrarily if we sought to reduce and limit
the mystery of the Trinity to the proposition just laid down.
Consciousness, understanding, will, love, in the sense of abstract
essences or qualities, belong only to abstract philosophy. But religion
is man&rsquo;s consciousness of himself in his concrete or living
totality, in which the identity of self-consciousness exists only as
the pregnant, complete unity of <i>I</i> and <i>thou</i>.</p>
<p>Religion, at least the Christian, is abstraction from the world; it
is essentially inward. The religious man leads a life withdrawn from
the world, hidden in God, still, void of worldly joy. He separates
himself from the world, not only in the ordinary sense, according to
which the renunciation of the world belongs to every true, earnest man,
but also in that wider sense which science gives to the word, when it
calls itself world-wisdom (<i lang="de">welt-weisheit</i>); but he thus
separates himself only because God is a being separate from the world,
an extra and supramundane being,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, abstractly and
philosophically expressed, the non-existence of the world. God, as an
extramundane being, is however nothing else than the nature of man
withdrawn from the world and concentrated in itself, freed from all
worldly ties and entanglements, transporting itself above the world,
and positing itself in this condition as a real objective being; or,
nothing else than the consciousness of the power to abstract oneself
from all that is external, and to live for and with oneself alone,
under the form which this power takes in religion, namely, that of a
being distinct, apart from man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2106src"
href="#xd21e2106" name="xd21e2106src">1</a> God as God, as a simple
being, is the being absolutely alone, solitary&mdash;absolute solitude
and self-sufficingness; for that only can be solitary which is
self-sufficing. To be able to be solitary is a sign of character and
thinking power. Solitude is the want of the thinker, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>society
the want of the heart. We can think alone, but we can love only with
another. In love we are dependent, for it is the need of another being;
we are independent only in the solitary act of thought. Solitude is
self-sufficingness.</p>
<p>But from a solitary God the essential need of duality, of love, of
community, of the real, completed self-consciousness, of the <i>alter
ego</i>, is excluded. This want is therefore satisfied by religion
thus: in the still solitude of the Divine Being is placed another, a
second, different from God as to personality, but identical with him in
essence,&mdash;God the Son, in distinction from God the Father. God the
Father is <i>I</i>, God the Son <i>Thou</i>. The <i>I</i> is
understanding, the <i>Thou</i> love. But love with understanding and
understanding with love is mind, and mind is the totality of man as
such&mdash;the total man.</p>
<p>Participated life is alone true, self-satisfying, divine
life:&mdash;this simple thought, this truth, natural, immanent in man,
is the secret, the supernatural mystery of the Trinity. But religion
expresses this truth, as it does every other, in an indirect manner,
<i>i.e.</i>, inversely, for it here makes a general truth into a
particular one, the true subject into a predicate, when it says: God is
a participated life, a life of love and friendship. The third Person in
the Trinity expresses nothing further than the love of the two divine
Persons towards each other; it is the unity of the Son and the Father,
the idea of community, strangely enough regarded in its turn as a
special personal being.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit owes its personal existence only to a name, a word.
The earliest Fathers of the Church are well known to have identified
the Spirit with the Son. Even later, its dogmatic personality wants
consistency. He is the love with which God loves himself and man, and,
on the other hand, he is the love with which man loves God and men.
Thus he is the identity of God and man, made objective according to the
usual mode of thought in religion, namely, as in itself a distinct
being. But for us this unity or identity is already involved in the
idea of the Father, and yet more in that of the Son. Hence we need not
make the Holy Spirit a separate object of our analysis. Only this one
remark further. In so far as the Holy Spirit represents the subjective
phase, he is properly the representation of the religious sentiment to
itself, the representation of religious emotion, of religious
enthusiasm, or the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span>personification, the rendering objective of
religion in religion. The Holy Spirit is therefore the sighing
creature, the yearning of the creature after God.</p>
<p>But that there are in fact only two Persons in the Trinity, the
third representing, as has been said, only love, is involved in this,
that to the strict idea of love two suffice. With two we have the
principle of multiplicity and all its essential results. Two is the
principle of multiplicity, and can therefore stand as its complete
substitute. If several Persons were posited, the force of love would
only be weakened&mdash;it would be dispersed. But love and the heart
are identical; the heart is no special power; it is the man who loves,
and in so far as he loves. The second Person is therefore the
self-assertion of the human heart as the principle of duality, of
participated life,&mdash;it is warmth; the Father is light, although
light was chiefly a predicate of the Son, because in him the Godhead
first became clear, comprehensible. But notwithstanding this, light as
a superterrestrial element may be ascribed to the Father, the
representative of the Godhead as such, the cold being of the
intelligence; and warmth, as a terrestrial element, to the Son. God as
the Son first gives warmth to man; here God, from an object of the
intellectual eye, of the indifferent sense of light, becomes an object
of feeling, of affection, of enthusiasm, of rapture; but only because
the Son is himself nothing else than the glow of love,
enthusiasm.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2148src" href="#xd21e2148" name=
"xd21e2148src">2</a> God as the Son is the primitive incarnation, the
primitive self-renunciation of God, the negation of God in God; for as
the Son he is a finite being, because he exists <i lang="la">ab
alio</i>, he has a source, whereas the Father has no source, he exists
<i lang="la">&agrave; se</i>. Thus in the second Person the essential
attribute of the Godhead, the attribute of self-existence, is given up.
But God the Father himself begets the Son; thus he renounces his
rigorous, exclusive divinity; he humiliates, lowers himself, evolves
within himself the principle of finiteness, of dependent existence; in
the Son he becomes man, not indeed, in the first instance, as to the
outward form, but as to the inward nature. And for this reason it is as
the Son that God first becomes the object of man, the object of
feeling, of the heart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69"
name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>The heart comprehends only what springs from the heart. From the
character of the subjective disposition and impressions the conclusion
is infallible as to the character of the object. The pure, free
understanding denies the Son,&mdash;not so the understanding determined
by feeling, overshadowed by the heart; on the contrary, it finds in the
Son the depths of the Godhead, because in him it finds feeling, which
in and by itself is something dark, obscure, and therefore appears to
man a mystery. The Son lays hold on the heart, because the <i>true</i>
Father of the Divine Son is the human heart,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2164src" href="#xd21e2164" name="xd21e2164src">3</a> and the Son
himself nothing else than the divine heart, <i>i.e.</i>, the human
heart become objective to itself as a Divine Being.</p>
<p>A God who has not in himself the quality of finiteness, the
principle of concrete existence, the essence of the feeling of
dependence, is no God for a finite, concrete being. The religious man
cannot love a God who has not the essence of love in himself, neither
can man, or, in general, any finite being, be an object to a God who
has not in himself the ground, the principle of finiteness. To such a
God there is wanting the sense, the understanding, the sympathy for
finiteness. How can God be the Father of men, how can he love other
beings subordinate to himself, if he has not in himself a subordinate
being, a Son, if he does not know what love is, so to speak, from his
own experience, in relation to himself? The single man takes far less
interest in the family sorrows of another than he who himself has
family ties. Thus God the Father loves men only in the Son and for the
sake of the Son. The love to man is derived from the love to the
Son.</p>
<p>The Father and Son in the Trinity are therefore father and son not
in a figurative sense, but in a strictly literal sense. The Father is a
real father in relation to the Son, the Son is a real son in relation
to the Father, or to God as the Father. The essential personal
distinction between them consists only in this, that the one begets,
the other is begotten. If this natural empirical condition is taken
away, their personal existence and reality are annihilated. The
Christians&mdash;we mean of course the Christians of former days, who
would with difficulty recognise the worldly, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>frivolous, pagan Christians of the modern world as
their brethren in Christ&mdash;substituted for the natural love and
unity immanent in man a purely religious love and unity; they rejected
the real life of the family, the intimate bond of love which is
naturally moral, as an undivine, unheavenly, <i>i.e.</i>, in truth, a
worthless thing. But in compensation they had a Father and Son in God,
who embraced each other with heartfelt love, with that intense love
which natural relationship alone inspires. On this account the mystery
of the Trinity was to the ancient Christians an object of unbounded
wonder, enthusiasm, and rapture, because here the satisfaction of those
profoundest human wants which in reality, in life, they denied, became
to them an object of contemplation in God.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2185src" href="#xd21e2185" name="xd21e2185src">4</a></p>
<p>It was therefore quite in order that, to complete the divine family,
the bond of love between Father and Son, a third, and that a feminine
person, was received into heaven; for the personality of the Holy
Spirit is a too vague and precarious, a too obviously poetic
personification of the mutual love of the Father and Son, to serve as
the third complementary being. It is true that the Virgin Mary was not
so placed between the Father and Son as to imply that the Father had
begotten the Son through her, because the sexual relation was regarded
by the Christians as something unholy and sinful; but it is enough that
the maternal principle was associated with the Father and Son.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, difficult to perceive why the Mother should be
something unholy, <i>i.e.</i>, unworthy of God, when once God is Father
and Son. Though it is held that the Father is not a father in the
natural sense&mdash;that, on the contrary, the divine generation is
quite different from the natural and human&mdash;still he remains a
Father, and a real, not a nominal or symbolical Father in relation to
the Son. And the idea of the Mother of God, which now appears so
strange to us, is therefore not really more strange or paradoxical,
than the idea of the Son of God, is not more in contradiction with the
general, abstract definition of God than the Sonship. On the contrary,
the Virgin Mary fits in perfectly with the relations of the Trinity,
since she conceives without man the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"
href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>Son whom the Father begets
without woman;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2203src" href="#xd21e2203"
name="xd21e2203src">5</a> so that thus the Holy Virgin is a necessary,
inherently requisite antithesis to the Father in the bosom of the
Trinity. Moreover we have, if not <i lang="la">in concreto</i> and
explicitly, yet <i lang="la">in abstracto</i> and implicitly, the
feminine principle already in the Son. The Son is the mild, gentle,
forgiving, conciliating being&mdash;the womanly sentiment of God. God,
as the Father, is the generator, the active, the principle of masculine
spontaneity; but the Son is begotten without himself begetting,
<i lang="la">Deus genitus</i>, the passive, suffering, receptive being;
he receives his existence from the Father. The Son, as a son, of course
not as God, is dependent on the Father, subject to his authority. The
Son is thus the feminine feeling of dependence in the Godhead; the Son
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2216" title=
"Source: implicity">implicitly</span> urges upon us the need of a real
feminine being.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2219src" href="#xd21e2219"
name="xd21e2219src">6</a></p>
<p>The son&mdash;I mean the natural, human son&mdash;considered as
such, is an intermediate being between the masculine nature of the
father and the feminine nature of the mother; he is, as it were, still
half a man, half a woman, inasmuch as he has not the full, rigorous
consciousness of independence which characterises the man, and feels
himself drawn rather to the mother than to the father. The love of the
son to the mother is the first love of the masculine being for the
feminine. The love of man to woman, the love of the youth for the
maiden, receives its religious&mdash;its sole truly religious
consecration in the love of the son to the mother; the son&rsquo;s love
for his mother is the first yearning of man towards woman&mdash;his
first humbling of himself before her.</p>
<p>Necessarily, therefore, the idea of the Mother of God is associated
with the idea of the Son of God,&mdash;the same heart that needed the
one needed the other also. Where the Son is, the Mother cannot be
absent; the Son is the only-begotten of the Father, but the Mother is
the concomitant of the Son. The Son is a substitute for the Mother to
the Father, but not so the Father to the Son. To the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>Son the
Mother is indispensable; the heart of the Son is the heart of the
Mother. Why did God become man only through woman? Could not the
Almighty have appeared as a man amongst men in another
manner&mdash;immediately? Why did the Son betake himself to the bosom
of the Mother?<a class="noteref" id="n100asrc" href="#n100a" name=
"n100asrc">7</a> For what other reason than because the Son is the
yearning after the Mother, because his womanly, tender heart found a
corresponding expression only in a feminine body? It is true that the
Son, as a natural man, dwells only temporarily in the shrine of this
body, but the impressions which he here receives are inextinguishable;
the Mother is never out of the mind and heart of the Son. If then the
worship of the Son of God is no idolatry, the worship of the Mother of
God is no idolatry. If herein we perceive the love of God to us, that
he gave us his only-begotten Son, <i>i.e.</i>, that which was dearest
to him, for our salvation,&mdash;we can perceive this love still better
when we find in God the beating of a mother&rsquo;s heart. The highest
and deepest love is the mother&rsquo;s love. The father consoles
himself for the loss of his son; he has a stoical principle within him.
The mother, on the contrary, is inconsolable; she is the sorrowing
element, that which cannot be indemnified&mdash;the true in love.</p>
<p>Where faith in the Mother of God sinks, there also sinks faith in
the Son of God, and in God as the Father. The Father is a truth only
where the Mother is a truth. Love is in and by itself essentially
feminine in its nature. The belief in the love of God is the belief in
the feminine principle as divine.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n100a">7</a> Love apart from living nature is an anomaly, a phantom.
Behold in love the holy necessity and depth of Nature!</p>
<p>Protestantism has set aside the Mother of God; but this deposition
of woman has been severely avenged.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2244src"
href="#xd21e2244" name="xd21e2244src">8</a> The arms which it has used
against the Mother of God have turned against itself, against the Son
of God, against the whole Trinity. He who has once offered up the
Mother of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>God to the understanding, is not far from
sacrificing the mystery of the Son of God as an anthropomorphism. The
anthropomorphism is certainly veiled when the feminine being is
excluded, but only veiled&mdash;not removed. It is true that
Protestantism had no need of the heavenly bride, because it received
with open arms the earthly bride. But for that very reason it ought to
have been consequent and courageous enough to give up not only the
Mother, but the Son and the Father. Only he who has no earthly parents
needs heavenly ones. The triune God is the God of Catholicism; he has a
profound, heartfelt, necessary, truly religious significance, only in
antithesis to the negation of all substantial bonds, in antithesis to
the life of the anchorite, the monk, and the nun.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2252src" href="#xd21e2252" name="xd21e2252src">9</a> The triune
God has a substantial meaning only where there is an abstraction from
the substance of real life. The more empty life is, the fuller, the
more concrete is God. The impoverishing of the real world and the
enriching of God is one act. Only the poor man has a rich God. God
springs out of the feeling of a want; what man is in need of, whether
this be a definite and therefore conscious, or an unconscious
need,&mdash;that is God. Thus the disconsolate feeling of a void, of
loneliness, needed a God in whom there is society, a union of beings
fervently loving each other.</p>
<p>Here we have the true explanation of the fact that the Trinity has
in modern times lost first its practical, and ultimately its
theoretical significance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=

<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY OF THE LOGOS AND DIVINE IMAGE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The essential significance of the Trinity is, however,
concentrated in the idea of the second Person. The warm interest of
Christians in the Trinity has been, in the main, only an interest in
the Son of God.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2266src" href="#xd21e2266"
name="xd21e2266src">1</a> The fierce contention concerning the
<i>Homousios</i> and <i>Homoiousios</i> was not an empty one, although
it turned upon a letter. The point in question was the co-equality and
divine dignity of the second Person, and therefore the honour of the
Christian religion itself; for its essential, characteristic object is
the second Person; and that which is essentially the object of a
religion is truly, essentially its God. The real God of any religion is
the so-called Mediator, because he alone is the immediate object of
religion. He who, instead of applying to God, applies to a saint, does
so only on the assumption that the saint has all power with God, that
what he prays for, <i>i.e.</i>, wishes and wills, God readily performs;
that thus God is entirely in the hands of the saint. Supplication is
the means, under the guise of humility and submission, of exercising
one&rsquo;s power and superiority over another being. That to which my
mind first turns is also, in truth, the first being to me. I turn to
the saint, not because the saint is dependent on God, but because God
is dependent on the saint, because God is determined and ruled by the
prayers, <i>i.e.</i>, by the wish or heart of the saint. The
distinctions which the Catholic theologians made between
<i>latreia</i>, <i>doulia</i>, and <i>hyperdoulia</i>, are absurd,
groundless sophisms. The God in the background of the Mediator is only
an abstract, inert conception, the conception or idea of the Godhead in
general; and it is not to reconcile us with this idea, but to remove it
to a distance, to negative it, because it is no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>object
for religion, that the Mediator interposes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2296src" href="#xd21e2296" name="xd21e2296src">2</a> God above
the Mediator is nothing else than the cold understanding above the
heart, like Fate above the Olympic gods.</p>
<p>Man, as an emotional and sensuous being, is governed and made happy
only by images, by sensible representations. Mind presenting itself as
at once type-creating, emotional, and sensuous, is the imagination. The
second Person in God, who is in truth the first person in religion, is
the nature of the imagination made objective. The definitions of the
second Person are principally images or symbols; and these images do
not proceed from man&rsquo;s incapability of conceiving the object
otherwise than symbolically,&mdash;which is an altogether false
interpretation,&mdash;but the thing cannot be conceived otherwise than
symbolically because the thing itself is a symbol or image. The Son is,
therefore, expressly called the Image of God; his essence is that he is
an image&mdash;the representation of God, the visible glory of the
invisible God. The Son is the satisfaction of the need for mental
images, the nature of the imaginative activity in man made objective as
an absolute, divine activity. Man makes to himself an image of God,
<i>i.e.</i>, he converts the abstract being of the reason, the being of
the thinking power, into an object of sense or imagination.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2316src" href="#xd21e2316" name="xd21e2316src">3</a>
But he places this image in God himself, because his want would not be
satisfied if he did not regard this image as an objective reality, if
it were nothing more for him than a subjective image, separate from
God,&mdash;a mere figment devised by man. And it is in fact no devised,
no arbitrary image; for it expresses the necessity of the imagination,
the necessity of affirming the imagination as a divine power. The Son
is the reflected splendour of the imagination, the image dearest to the
heart; but for the very reason that he is only an object of the
imagination, he is only the nature of the imagination made
objective.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2319src" href="#xd21e2319" name=
"xd21e2319src">4</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is clear from this how blinded by prejudice dogmatic speculation
is, when, entirely overlooking the inward genesis of the Son of God as
the Image of God, it demonstrates the Son as a metaphysical <i>ens</i>,
as an object of thought, whereas the Son is a declension, a falling off
from the metaphysical idea of the Godhead;&mdash;a falling off,
however, which religion naturally places in God himself, in order to
justify it, and not to feel it as a falling off. The Son is the chief
and ultimate principle of image-worship, for he is the image of God;
and the image necessarily takes the place of the thing. The adoration
of the saint in his image is the adoration of the image as the saint.
Wherever the image is the essential expression, the organ of religion,
there also it is the essence of religion.</p>
<p>The Council of Nice adduced, amongst other grounds for the religious
use of images, the authority of Gregory of Nyssa, who said that he
could never look at an image which represented the sacrifice of Isaac
without being moved to tears, because it so vividly brought before him
that event in sacred history. But the effect of the represented object
is not the effect of the object as such, but the effect of the
representation. The holy object is simply the haze of holiness in which
the image veils its mysterious power. The religious object is only a
pretext, by means of which art or imagination can exercise its dominion
over men unhindered. For the religious consciousness, it is true, the
sacredness of the image is associated, and necessarily so, only with
the sacredness of the object; but the religious consciousness is not
the measure of truth. Indeed, the Church itself, while insisting on the
distinction between the image and the object of the image, and denying
that the worship is paid to the image, has at the same time made at
least an indirect admission of the truth, by itself declaring the
sacredness of the image.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2330src" href=
"#xd21e2330" name="xd21e2330src">5</a></p>
<p>But the ultimate, highest principle of image-worship is the worship
of the Image of God in God. The Son, who is the &ldquo;brightness of
his glory, the express image of his person,&rdquo; is the entrancing
splendour of the imagination, which only manifests itself in visible
images. Both to inward and outward contemplation the representation of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>Christ, the Image of God, was the image of images.
The images of the saints are only optical multiplications of one and
the same image. The speculative deduction of the Image of God is
therefore nothing more than an unconscious deduction and establishing
of image-worship: for the sanction of the principle is also the
sanction of its necessary consequences; the sanction of the archetype
is the sanction of its semblance. If God has an image of himself, why
should not I have an image of God? If God loves his Image as himself,
why should not I also love the Image of God as I love God himself? If
the Image of God is God himself, why should not the image of the saint
be the saint himself? If it is no superstition to believe that the
image which God makes of himself is no image, no mere conception, but a
substance, a person, why should it be a superstition to believe that
the image of the saint is the sensitive substance of the saint? The
Image of God weeps and bleeds; why then should not the image of a saint
also weep and bleed? Does the distinction lie in the fact that the
image of the saint is a product of the hands? Why, the hands did not
make this image, but the mind which animated the hands, the
imagination; and if God makes an image of himself, that also is only a
product of the imagination. Or does the distinction proceed from this,
that the Image of God is produced by God himself, whereas the image of
the saint is made by another? Why, the image of the saint is also a
product of the saint himself: for he appears to the artist; the artist
only represents him as he appears.</p>
<p>Connected with the nature of the image is another definition of the
second Person, namely, that he is the Word of God.</p>
<p>A word is an abstract image, the imaginary thing, or, in so far as
everything is ultimately an object of the thinking power, it is the
imagined thought: hence men, when they know the word, the name for a
thing, fancy that they know the thing also. Words are a result of the
imagination. Sleepers who dream vividly and invalids who are delirious
speak. The power of speech is a poetic talent. Brutes do not speak
because they have no poetic faculty. Thought expresses itself only by
images; the power by which thought expresses itself is the imagination;
the imagination expressing itself is speech. He who speaks, lays under
a spell, fascinates those to whom he speaks; but the power of words is
the power of the imagination. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>Therefore to the ancients, as
children of the imagination, the Word was a being&mdash;a mysterious,
magically powerful being. Even the Christians, and not only the vulgar
among them, but also the learned, the Fathers of the Church, attached
to the mere <i>name</i> Christ, mysterious powers of healing.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2346src" href="#xd21e2346" name="xd21e2346src">6</a>
And in the present day the common people still believe that it is
possible to bewitch men by mere words. Whence comes this ascription of
imaginary influences to words? Simply from this, that words themselves
are only a result of the imagination, and hence have the effect of a
narcotic on man, imprison him under the power of the imagination. Words
possess a revolutionising force; words govern mankind. Words are held
sacred; while the <i>things</i> of reason and truth are decried.</p>
<p>The affirming or making objective of the nature of the imagination
is therefore directly connected with the affirming or making objective
of the nature of speech, of the word. Man has not only an instinct, an
internal necessity, which impels him to think, to perceive, to imagine;
he has also the impulse to speak, to utter, impart his thoughts. A
divine impulse this&mdash;a divine power, the power of words. The word
is the imaged, revealed, radiating, lustrous, enlightening thought. The
word is the light of the world. The word guides to all truth, unfolds
all mysteries, reveals the unseen, makes present the past and the
future, defines the infinite, perpetuates the transient. Men pass away,
the word remains; the word is life and truth. All power is given to the
word: the word makes the blind see and the lame walk, heals the sick,
and brings the dead to life;&mdash;the word works miracles, and the
only rational miracles. The word is the gospel, the paraclete of
mankind. To convince thyself of the divine nature of speech, imagine
thyself alone and forsaken, yet acquainted with language; and imagine
thyself further hearing for the first time the word of a human being:
would not this word seem to thee angelic? would it not sound like the
voice of God himself, like heavenly music? Words are not really less
rich, less pregnant than music, though music seems to say more, and
appears deeper and richer than words, for this reason simply, that it
is invested with that prepossession, that illusion. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>The word has power to redeem, to reconcile, to bless, to make free.
The sins which we confess are forgiven us by virtue of the divine power
of the word. The dying man who gives forth in speech his long-concealed
sins departs reconciled. The forgiveness of sins lies in the confession
of sins. The sorrows which we confide to our friend are already half
healed. Whenever we speak of a subject, the passions which it has
excited in us are allayed; we see more clearly; the object of anger, of
vexation, of sorrow, appears to us in a light in which we perceive the
unworthiness of those passions. If we are in darkness and doubt on any
matter, we need only speak of it;&mdash;often in the very moment in
which we open our lips to consult a friend, the doubts and difficulties
disappear. The word makes man free. He who cannot express himself is a
slave. Hence, excessive passion, excessive joy, excessive grief, are
speechless. To speak is an act of freedom; the word is freedom. Justly
therefore is language held to be the root of culture; where language is
cultivated, man is cultivated. The barbarism of the Middle Ages
disappeared before the revival of language.</p>
<p>As we can conceive nothing else as a Divine Being than the Rational
which we think, the Good which we love, the Beautiful which we
perceive; so we know no higher spiritually operative power and
expression of power than the power of the Word.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2363src" href="#xd21e2363" name="xd21e2363src">7</a> God is the
sum of all reality. All that man feels or knows as a reality he must
place in God or regard as God. Religion must therefore be conscious of
the power of the word as a divine power. The Word of God is the
divinity of the word, as it becomes an object to man within the sphere
of religion,&mdash;the true nature of the human word. The Word of God
is supposed to be distinguished from the human word in that it is no
transient breath, but an imparted being. But does not the word of man
also contain the being of man, his imparted self,&mdash;at least when
it is a true word? Thus religion takes the <i>appearance</i> of the
human word for its essence; hence it necessarily conceives the true
nature of the Word to be a special being, distinct from the human word.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The second Person, as God revealing, manifesting,
declaring himself (<i lang="la">Deus se dicit</i>), is the
world-creating principle in God. But this means nothing else than that
the second Person is intermediate between the noumenal nature of God
and the phenomenal nature of the world, that he is the divine principle
of the finite, of that which is distinguished from God. The second
Person as begotten, as not <i>&agrave; se</i>, not existing of himself,
has the fundamental condition of the finite in himself.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2384src" href="#xd21e2384" name="xd21e2384src">1</a>
But at the same time, he is not yet a real finite Being, posited out of
God; on the contrary, he is still identical with God,&mdash;as
identical as the son is with the father, the son being indeed another
person, but still of like nature with the father. The second Person,
therefore, does not represent to us the pure idea of the Godhead, but
neither does he represent the pure idea of humanity, or of reality in
general: he is an intermediate Being between the two opposites. The
opposition of the noumenal or invisible divine nature and the
phenomenal or visible nature of the world, is, however, nothing else
than the opposition between the nature of abstraction and the nature of
perception; but that which connects abstraction with perception is the
imagination: consequently, the transition from God to the world by
means of the second Person, is only the form in which religion makes
objective the transition from abstraction to perception by means of the
imagination. It is the imagination alone by which man neutralises the
opposition between God and the world. All religious cosmogonies are
products of the imagination. Every being, intermediate between God and
the world, let it be defined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>how it may, is a being of the
imagination. The psychological truth and necessity which lies at the
foundation of all these theogonies and cosmogonies is the truth and
necessity of the imagination as a middle term between the abstract and
concrete. And the task of philosophy in investigating this subject is
to comprehend the relation of the imagination to the reason,&mdash;the
genesis of the image by means of which an object of thought becomes an
object of sense, of feeling.</p>
<p>But the nature of the imagination is the complete, exhaustive truth
of the cosmogonic principle, only where the antithesis of God and the
world expresses nothing but the indefinite antithesis of the noumenal,
invisible, incomprehensible being, God, and the visible, tangible
existence of the world. If, on the other hand, the cosmogonic being is
conceived and expressed abstractly, as is the case in religious
speculation, we have also to recognise a more abstract psychological
truth as its foundation.</p>
<p>The world is not God; it is other than God, the opposite of God, or
at least that which is different from God. But that which is different
from God cannot have come immediately from God, but only from a
distinction of God in God. The second Person is God distinguishing
himself from himself in himself, setting himself opposite to himself,
hence being an object to himself. The self-distinguishing of God from
himself is the ground of that which is different from himself, and thus
self-consciousness is the origin of the world. God first thinks the
world in thinking himself: to think oneself is to beget oneself, to
think the world is to create the world. Begetting precedes creating.
The idea of the production of the world, of another being who is
<i>not</i> God, is attained through the idea of the production of
another being who is <i>like</i> God.</p>
<p>This cosmogonical process is nothing else than the mystic paraphrase
of a psychological process, nothing else than the unity of
consciousness and self-consciousness made objective. God thinks
himself:&mdash;thus he is self-conscious. God is self-consciousness
posited as an object, as a being; but inasmuch as he knows himself,
thinks himself, he also thinks another than himself; for to know
oneself is to distinguish oneself from another, whether this be a
possible, merely conceptional, or a real being. Thus the world&mdash;at
least the possibility, the idea of the world&mdash;is posited with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>consciousness, or rather conveyed in it. The Son,
<i>i.e.</i>, God thought by himself, objective to himself, the original
reflection of God, the other God, is the principle of creation. The
truth which lies at the foundation of this is the nature of man: the
identity of his self-consciousness with his consciousness of another
who is identical with himself, and of another who is not identical with
himself. And the second, the other who is of like nature, is
necessarily the middle term between the first and third. The idea of
another in general, of one who is essentially different from me, arises
to me first through the idea of one who is essentially like me.</p>
<p>Consciousness of the world is the consciousness of my limitation: if
I knew nothing of a world, I should know nothing of limits; but the
consciousness of my limitation stands in contradiction with the impulse
of my egoism towards unlimitedness. Thus from egoism conceived as
absolute (God is the absolute Self) I cannot pass immediately to its
opposite; I must introduce, prelude, moderate this contradiction by the
consciousness of a being who is indeed another, and in so far gives me
the perception of my limitation, but in such a way as at the same time
to affirm my own nature, make my nature objective to me. The
consciousness of the world is a humiliating consciousness; the creation
was an &ldquo;act of humility;&rdquo; but the first stone against which
the pride of egoism stumbles is the <i>thou</i>, the <i>alter ego</i>.
The <i>ego</i> first steels its glance in the eye of a <i>thou</i>
before it endures the contemplation of a being which does not reflect
its own image. My fellow-man is the bond between me and the world. I
am, and I feel myself, dependent on the world, because I first feel
myself dependent on other men. If I did not need man, I should not need
the world. I reconcile myself with the world only through my
fellow-man. Without other men, the world would be for me not only dead
and empty, but meaningless. Only through his fellow does man become
clear to himself and self-conscious; but only when I am clear to myself
does the world become clear to me. A man existing absolutely alone
would lose himself without any sense of his individuality in the ocean
of Nature; he would neither comprehend himself as man nor Nature as
Nature. The first object of man is man. The sense of Nature, which
opens to us the consciousness of the world as a world, is a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>later product; for it first arises through the
distinction of man from himself. The natural philosophers of Greece
were preceded by the so-called seven Sages, whose wisdom had immediate
reference to human life only.</p>
<p>The <i>ego</i>, then, attains to consciousness of the world through
consciousness of the <i>thou</i>. Thus man is the God of man. That he
is, he has to thank Nature; that he is man, he has to thank man;
spiritually as well as physically he can achieve nothing without his
fellow-man. Four hands can do more than two, but also four eyes can see
more than two. And this combined power is distinguished not only in
quantity but also in quality from that which is solitary. In isolation
human power is limited, in combination it is infinite. The knowledge of
a single man is limited, but reason, science, is unlimited, for it is a
common act of mankind; and it is so, not only because innumerable men
co-operate in the construction of science, but also in the more
profound sense, that the scientific genius of a particular age
comprehends in itself the thinking powers of the preceding age, though
it modifies them in accordance with its own special character. Wit,
acumen, imagination, feeling as distinguished from sensation, reason as
a subjective faculty,&mdash;all these so-called powers of the soul are
powers of humanity, not of man as an individual; they are products of
culture, products of human society. Only where man has contact and
friction with his fellow-man are wit and sagacity kindled; hence there
is more wit in the town than in the country, more in great towns than
in small ones. Only where man suns and warms himself in the proximity
of man arise feeling and imagination. Love, which requires mutuality,
is the spring of poetry; and only where man communicates with man, only
in speech, a social act, awakes reason. To ask a question and to answer
are the first acts of thought. Thought originally demands two. It is
not until man has reached an advanced stage of culture that he can
double himself, so as to play the part of another within himself. To
think and to speak are therefore, with all ancient and sensuous
nations, identical; they think only in speaking; their thought is only
conversation. The common people, <i>i.e.</i>, people in whom the power
of abstraction has not been developed, are still incapable of
understanding what is written if they do not read it audibly, if they
do not pronounce <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>what they read. In this point of view Hobbes
correctly enough derives the understanding of man from his ears!</p>
<p>Reduced to abstract logical categories, the creative principle in
God expresses nothing further than the tautological proposition: the
different can only proceed from a principle of difference, not from a
simple being. However the Christian philosophers and theologians
insisted on the creation of the world out of nothing, they were unable
altogether to evade the old axiom&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing comes from
nothing,&rdquo; because it expresses a law of thought. It is true that
they supposed no real matter as the principle of the diversity of
material things, but they made the divine understanding (and the Son is
the wisdom, the science, the understanding of the Father)&mdash;as that
which comprehends within itself all things as <i>spiritual
matter</i>&mdash;the principle of real matter. The distinction between
the heathen eternity of matter and the Christian creation in this
respect is only that the heathens ascribed to the world a real,
objective eternity, whereas the Christians gave it an invisible,
immaterial eternity. Things were before they existed
positively,&mdash;not, indeed, as an object of sense, but of the
subjective understanding. The Christians, whose principle is that of
absolute subjectivity, conceive all things as effected only through
this principle. The matter posited by their subjective thought,
conceptional, subjective matter, is therefore to them the first
matter,&mdash;far more excellent than real, objective matter.
Nevertheless, this distinction is only a distinction in the mode of
existence. The world is eternal in God. Or did it spring up in him as a
sudden idea, a caprice? Certainly man can conceive this too; but, in
doing so, he deifies nothing but his own irrationality. If, on the
contrary, I abide by reason, I can only derive the world from its
essence, its idea, <i>i.e.</i>, one mode of its existence from another
mode; in other words, I can derive the world only from itself. The
world has its basis in itself, as has everything in the world which has
a claim to the name of species. The <i>differentia specifica</i>, the
peculiar character, that by which a given being is what it is, is
always in the ordinary sense inexplicable, undeducible, is through
itself, has its cause in itself.</p>
<p>The distinction between the world and God as the creator of the
world is therefore only a formal one. The nature of God&mdash;for the
divine understanding, that which comprehends <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>within
itself all things, is the divine nature itself; hence God, inasmuch as
he thinks and knows himself, thinks and knows at the same time the
world and all things&mdash;the nature of God is nothing else than the
abstract, <i>thought</i> nature of the world; the nature of the world
nothing else than the real, concrete, perceptible nature of God. Hence
creation is nothing more than a formal act; for that which, before the
creation, was an object of thought, of the understanding, is by
creation simply made an object of sense, its ideal contents continuing
the same; although it remains absolutely inexplicable how a real
material thing can spring out of a pure thought.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2453src" href="#xd21e2453" name="xd21e2453src">2</a></p>
<p>So it is with plurality and difference&mdash;if we reduce the world
to these abstract categories&mdash;in opposition to the unity and
identity of the Divine nature. Real difference can be derived only from
a being which has a principle of difference in itself. But I posit
difference in the original being, because I have originally found
difference as a positive reality. Wherever difference is in itself
nothing, there also no difference is conceived in the principle of
things. I posit difference as an essential category, as a truth, where
I derive it from the original being, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>: the
two propositions are identical. The rational expression is this:
Difference lies as necessarily in the reason as identity.</p>
<p>But as difference is a positive condition of the reason, I cannot
deduce it without presupposing it; I cannot explain it except by
itself, because it is an original, self-luminous, self-attesting
reality. Through what means arises the world, that which is
distinguished from God? through the distinguishing of God from himself
in himself. God thinks himself, he is an object to himself; he
distinguishes himself from himself. Hence this distinction, the world,
arises only from a distinction of another kind, the external
distinction from an internal one, the static distinction from a dynamic
one,&mdash;from an <i>act</i> of distinction: thus I establish
difference only through itself, <i>i.e.</i>, it is an original concept,
a <i>ne plus ultra</i> of my thought, a law, a necessity, a truth. The
last distinction that I can think is the distinction of a being from
and in itself. The distinction of one being from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>another
is self-evident, is already implied in their existence, is a palpable
truth: they are two. But I first establish difference for thought when
I discern it in one and the same being, when I unite it with the law of
identity. Herein lies the ultimate truth of difference. The cosmogonic
principle in God, reduced to its last elements, is nothing else than
the act of thought in its simplest forms made objective. If I remove
difference from God, he gives me no material for thought; he ceases to
be an object of thought; for difference is an essential principle of
thought. And if I consequently place difference in God, what else do I
establish, what else do I make an object, than the truth and necessity
of this principle of thought? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=

<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY OF MYSTICISM, OR OF NATURE IN GOD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Interesting material for the criticism of cosmogonic
and theogonic fancies is furnished in the doctrine&mdash;revived by
Schelling and drawn from Jacob B&ouml;hme&mdash;of eternal Nature in
God.</p>
<p>God is pure spirit, clear self-consciousness, moral personality;
Nature, on the contrary, is, at least partially, confused, dark,
desolate, immoral, or to say no more, unmoral. But it is
self-contradictory that the impure should proceed from the pure,
darkness from light. How then can we remove these obvious difficulties
in the way of assigning a divine origin to Nature? Only by positing
this impurity, this darkness in God, by distinguishing in God himself a
principle of light and a principle of darkness. In other words, we can
only explain the origin of darkness by renouncing the idea of origin,
and presupposing darkness as existing from the beginning.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2486src" href="#xd21e2486" name=
"xd21e2486src">1</a></p>
<p>But that which is dark in Nature is the irrational, the material,
Nature strictly, as distinguished from intelligence. Hence the simple
meaning of this doctrine is, that Nature, Matter, cannot be explained
as a result of intelligence; on the contrary, it is the basis of
intelligence, the basis of personality, without itself having any
basis; spirit without Nature is an unreal abstraction; consciousness
develops itself only out of Nature. But this materialistic doctrine is
veiled in a mystical yet attractive obscurity, inasmuch as it is not
expressed in the clear, simple language of reason, but emphatically
enunciated in that consecrated word of the emotions&mdash;God. If the
light in God springs out of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>darkness in God, this is only
because it is involved in the idea of light in general, that it
illuminates darkness, thus presupposing darkness, not making it. If
then God is once subjected to a general law,&mdash;as he must
necessarily be unless he be made the arena of conflict for the most
senseless notions,&mdash;if self-consciousness in God as well as in
itself, as in general, is evolved from a principle in Nature, why is
not this natural principle abstracted from God? That which is a law of
consciousness in itself is a law for the consciousness of every
personal being, whether man, angel, demon, God, or whatever else thou
mayest conceive to thyself as a being. To what then, seen in their true
light, do the two principles in God reduce themselves? The one to
Nature, at least to Nature as it exists in the conception, abstracted
from its reality; the other to mind, consciousness, personality. The
one half, the reverse side, thou dost not name God, but only the
obverse side, on which he presents to thee mind, consciousness: thus
his specific essence, that whereby he is <i>God</i>, is mind,
intelligence, consciousness. Why then dost thou make that which is
properly the subject in God as God, <i>i.e.</i>, as mind, into a mere
predicate, as if God existed as God apart from mind, from
consciousness? Why, but because thou art enslaved by mystical religious
speculation, because the primary principle in thee is the imagination,
thought being only secondary and serving but to throw into
formul&aelig; the products of the imagination,&mdash;because thou
feelest at ease and at home only in the deceptive twilight of
mysticism.</p>
<p>Mysticism is deuteroscopy&mdash;a fabrication of phrases having a
double meaning. The mystic speculates concerning the essence of Nature
or of man, but under, and by means of, the supposition that he is
speculating concerning another, a personal being, distinct from both.
The mystic has the same objects as the plain, self-conscious thinker;
but the real object is regarded by the mystic, not as itself, but as an
imaginary being, and hence the imaginary object is to him the real
object. Thus here, in the mystical doctrine of the two principles in
God, the real object is pathology, the imaginary one, theology;
<i>i.e.</i>, pathology is converted into theology. There would be
nothing to urge against this, if consciously real pathology were
recognised and expressed as theology; indeed, it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>precisely our task to show that theology is
nothing else than an unconscious, esoteric pathology, anthropology, and
psychology, and that therefore real anthropology, real pathology, and
real psychology have far more claim to the name of theology than has
theology itself, because this is nothing more than an imaginary
psychology and anthropology. But this doctrine or theory is
supposed&mdash;and for this reason it is mystical and
fantastic&mdash;to be not pathology, but theology, in the old or
ordinary sense of the word; it is supposed that we have here unfolded
to us the life of a Being distinct from us, while nevertheless it is
only our own nature which is unfolded, though at the same time again
shut up from us by the fact that this nature is represented as inhering
in another being. The mystic philosopher supposes that in God, not in
us human individuals,&mdash;that would be far too trivial a
truth,&mdash;reason first appears after the Passion of
Nature;&mdash;that not man, but God, has wrestled himself out of the
obscurity of confused feelings and impulses into the clearness of
knowledge; that not in our subjective, limited mode of conception, but
in God himself, the nervous tremors of darkness precede the joyful
consciousness of light; in short, he supposes that his theory presents
not a history of human throes, but a history of the development,
<i>i.e.</i>, the throes of God&mdash;for developments (or transitions)
are birth-struggles. But, alas! this supposition itself belongs only to
the pathological element.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the cosmogonic process presents to us the Light of
the power of distinction as belonging to the divine essence; so, on the
other hand, the Night or Nature in God represents to us the
<i>Pens&eacute;es confuses</i> of Leibnitz as divine powers. But the
<i>Pens&eacute;es confuses</i>&mdash;confused, obscure conceptions and
thoughts, or more correctly images&mdash;represent the flesh,
matter;&mdash;a pure intelligence, separate from matter, has only
clear, free thoughts, no obscure, <i>i.e.</i>, fleshly ideas, no
material images, exciting the imagination and setting the blood in
commotion. The Night in God, therefore, implies nothing else than this:
God is not only a spiritual, but also a material, corporeal, fleshly
being; but as man is man, and receives his designation, in virtue not
of his fleshly nature, but of his mind, so is it with God.</p>
<p>But the mystic philosopher expresses this only in obscure, mystical,
indefinite, dissembling images. Instead of the rude, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>but
hence all the more precise and striking expression, <i>flesh</i>, it
substitutes the equivocal, abstract words <i>nature</i> and
<i>ground</i>. &ldquo;As nothing is before or out of God, he must have
the ground of his existence in himself. This all philosophies say, but
they speak of this ground as a mere idea, without making it something
real. This ground of his existence which God has in himself, is not God
considered absolutely, <i>i.e.</i>, in so far as he exists; it is only
the ground of his existence. It is Nature&mdash;in God; an existence
inseparable from him, it is true, but still distinct. Analogically (?),
this relation may be illustrated by gravitation and light in
Nature.&rdquo; But this ground is the <i>non-intelligent</i> in God.
&ldquo;That which is the commencement of an intelligence (in itself)
cannot also be intelligent.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the strict sense,
intelligence is born of this unintelligent principle. Without this
antecedent darkness there is no reality of the Creator.&rdquo;
&ldquo;With abstract ideas of God as <i lang="la">actus purissimus</i>,
such as were laid down by the older philosophy, or such as the modern,
out of anxiety to remove God far from Nature, is always reproducing, we
can effect nothing. God is something more real than a mere moral order
of the world, and has quite another and a more living motive power in
himself than is ascribed to him by the jejune subtilty of abstract
idealists. Idealism, if it has not a living realism as its basis, is as
empty and abstract a system as that of Leibnitz or Spinoza, or as any
other dogmatic system.&rdquo; &ldquo;So long as the God of modern
theism remains the simple, supposed purely essential, but in fact
non-essential Being that all modern systems make him, so long as a real
duality is not recognised in God, and a limiting, negativing force,
opposed to the expansive affirming force, so long will the denial of a
personal God be scientific honesty.&rdquo; &ldquo;All consciousness is
concentration, is a gathering together, a collecting of oneself. This
negativing force, by which a being turns back upon itself, is the true
force of personality, the force of egoism.&rdquo; &ldquo;How should
there be a fear of God if there were no strength in him? But that there
should be something in God which is mere force and strength cannot be
held astonishing if only it be not maintained that he is this alone and
nothing besides.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2543src" href=
"#xd21e2543" name="xd21e2543src">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>But what then is force and strength which is merely such, if not
corporeal force and strength? Dost thou know any power which stands at
thy command, in distinction from the power of kindness and reason,
besides muscular power? If thou canst effect nothing through kindness
and the arguments of reason, force is what thou must take refuge in.
But canst thou &ldquo;effect&rdquo; anything without strong arms and
fists? Is there known to thee, in distinction from the power of the
moral order of the world, &ldquo;another and more living motive
power&rdquo; than the lever of the criminal court? Is not Nature
without body also an &ldquo;empty, abstract&rdquo; idea, a
&ldquo;jejune subtilty&rdquo;? Is not the mystery of Nature the mystery
of corporeality? Is not the system of a &ldquo;living realism&rdquo;
the system of the organised body? Is there, in general, any other
force, the opposite of intelligence, than the force of flesh and
blood,&mdash;any other strength of Nature than the strength of the
fleshly impulses? And the strongest of the impulses of Nature, is it
not the sexual feeling? Who does not remember the old proverb:
&ldquo;<i lang="la">Amare et sapere vix Deo competit</i>?&rdquo; So
that if we would posit in God a nature, an existence opposed to the
light of intelligence,&mdash;can we think of a more living, a more real
antithesis, than that of <i lang="la">amare</i> and <i lang=
"la">sapere</i>, of spirit and flesh, of freedom and the sexual
impulse?</p>
<p>Personality, individuality, consciousness, without Nature, is
nothing; or, which is the same thing, an empty, unsubstantial
abstraction. But Nature, as has been shown and is obvious, is nothing
without corporeality. The body alone is that negativing, limiting,
concentrating, circumscribing force, without which no personality is
conceivable. Take away from thy personality its body, and thou takest
away that which holds it together. The body is the basis, the subject
of personality. Only by the body is a real personality distinguished
from the imaginary one of a spectre. What sort of abstract, vague,
empty personalities should we be, if we had not the property of
impenetrability,&mdash;if in the same place, in the same form in which
we are, others might stand at the same time? Only by the exclusion of
others from the space it occupies does personality prove itself to be
real. But a body does not exist without flesh and blood. Flesh and
blood is life, and life alone is corporeal reality. But flesh and blood
is nothing without the oxygen of sexual <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>distinction. The
distinction of sex is not superficial, or limited to certain parts of
the body; it is an essential one: it penetrates bones and marrow. The
substance of man is manhood; that of woman, womanhood. However
spiritual and supersensual the man may be, he remains always a man; and
it is the same with the woman. Hence personality is nothing without
distinction of sex; personality is essentially distinguished into
masculine and feminine. Where there is no <i>thou</i>, there is no
<i>I</i>; but the distinction between <i>I</i> and <i>thou</i>, the
fundamental condition of all personality, of all consciousness, is only
real, living, ardent, when felt as the distinction between man and
woman. The <i>thou</i> between man and woman has quite another sound
than the monotonous <i>thou</i> between friends.</p>
<p>Nature in distinction from personality can signify nothing else than
difference of sex. A personal being apart from Nature is nothing else
than a being without sex, and conversely. Nature is said to be
predicated of God, &ldquo;in the sense in which it is said of a man
that he is of a strong, healthy nature.&rdquo; But what is more feeble,
what more insupportable, what more contrary to Nature, than a person
without sex, or a person who in character, manners, or feelings denies
sex? What is virtue, the excellence of man as man? Manhood. Of man as
woman? Womanhood. But man exists only as man and woman. The strength,
the healthiness of man consists therefore in this: that as a woman, he
be truly woman; as man, truly man. Thou repudiatest &ldquo;the horror
of all that is real, which supposes the spiritual to be polluted by
contact with the real.&rdquo; Repudiate then, before all, thy own
horror for the distinction of sex. If God is not polluted by Nature,
neither is he polluted by being associated with the idea of sex. In
renouncing sex, thou renouncest thy whole principle. A moral God apart
from Nature is without basis; but the basis of morality is the
distinction of sex. Even the brute is capable of self-sacrificing love
in virtue of the sexual distinction. All the glory of Nature, all its
power, all its wisdom and profundity, concentrates and individualises
itself in distinction of sex. Why then dost thou shrink from naming the
nature of God by its true name? Evidently, only because thou hast a
general horror of things in their truth and reality; because thou
lookest at all things through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>the deceptive vapours of mysticism.
For this very reason then, because Nature in God is only a delusive,
unsubstantial appearance, a fantastic ghost of Nature,&mdash;for it is
based, as we have said, not on flesh and blood, not on a real
ground,&mdash;this attempt to establish a personal God is once more a
failure, and I, too, conclude with the words, &ldquo;The denial of a
personal God will be scientific honesty:&rdquo;&mdash;and, I add,
scientific truth, so long as it is not declared and shown in
unequivocal terms, first <i>&agrave; priori</i>, on speculative
grounds, that form, place, corporeality, and sex do not contradict the
idea of the Godhead; and secondly, <i>&agrave;
posteriori</i>,&mdash;for the reality of a personal being is sustained
only on empirical grounds,&mdash;what sort of form God has, where he
exists,&mdash;in heaven,&mdash;and lastly, of what sex he is.</p>
<p>Let the profound, speculative religious philosophers of Germany
courageously shake off the embarrassing remnant of rationalism which
yet clings to them, in flagrant contradiction with their true
character; and let them complete their system, by converting the
mystical &ldquo;potence&rdquo; of Nature in God into a really powerful,
generating God.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Nature in God is borrowed from Jacob B&ouml;hme. But
in the original it has a far deeper and more interesting significance
than in its second modernised and emasculated edition. Jacob B&ouml;hme
has a profoundly religious mind. Religion is the centre of his life and
thought. But at the same time, the significance which has been given to
Nature in modern times&mdash;by the study of natural science, by
Spinozism, materialism, empiricism&mdash;has taken possession of his
religious sentiment. He has opened his senses to Nature, thrown a
glance into her mysterious being; but it alarms him, and he cannot
harmonise this terror at Nature with his religious conceptions.
&ldquo;When I looked into the great depths of this world, and at the
sun and stars, also at the clouds, also at the rain and snow, and
considered in my mind the whole creation of this world; then I found in
all things evil and good, love and anger,&mdash;in unreasoning things,
such as wood, stone, earth, and the elements, as well as in men and
beasts.... But because I found that in all things there was good and
evil, in the elements as well as in the creatures, and that it goes as
well in the world with the godless as with the pious, also that the
barbarous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>nations possess the best lands, and have more
prosperity than the godly; I was therefore altogether melancholy and
extremely troubled, and the Scriptures could not console me, though
almost all well known to me; and therewith assuredly the devil was not
idle, for he often thrust upon me heathenish thoughts, of which I will
here be silent.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2600src" href=
"#xd21e2600" name="xd21e2600src">3</a> But while his mind seized with
fearful earnestness the dark side of Nature, which did not harmonise
with the religious idea of a heavenly Creator, he was on the other hand
rapturously affected by her resplendent aspects. Jacob B&ouml;hme has a
sense for Nature. He preconceives, nay, he feels the joys of the
mineralogist, of the botanist, of the chemist&mdash;the joys of
&ldquo;godless natural science.&rdquo; He is enraptured by the
splendour of jewels, the tones of metals, the hues and odours of
plants, the beauty and gentleness of many animals. In another place,
speaking of the revelation of God in the phenomena of light, the
process by which &ldquo;there arises in the Godhead the wondrous and
beautiful structure of the heavens in various colours and kinds, and
every spirit shows itself in its form specially,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;I can compare it with nothing but with the noblest precious
stones, such as the ruby, emerald, epidote, onyx, sapphire, diamond,
jasper, hyacinth, amethyst, beryl, sardine, carbuncle, and the
like.&rdquo; Elsewhere: &ldquo;But regarding the precious stones, such
as the carbuncle, ruby, emerald, epidote, onyx, and the like, which are
the very best, these have the very same origin&mdash;the flash of light
in love. For that flash is born in tenderness, and is the heart in the
centre of the Fountain-spirit, wherefore those stones also are mild,
powerful, and lovely.&rdquo; It is evident that Jacob B&ouml;hme had no
bad taste in mineralogy; that he had delight in flowers also, and
consequently a faculty for botany, is proved by the following passages
among others:&mdash;&ldquo;The heavenly powers gave birth to heavenly
joy-giving fruits and colours, to all sorts of trees and shrubs,
whereupon grows the beauteous and lovely fruit of life: also there
spring up in these powers all sorts of flowers with beauteous heavenly
colours and scents. Their taste is various, in each according to its
quality and kind, altogether holy, divine, and joy-giving.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If thou desirest to contemplate the heavenly, divine pomp and
glory, as they are, and to know what sort of products, pleasure, or
joys there are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>above: look diligently at this world, at the
varieties of fruits and plants that grow upon the earth,&mdash;trees,
shrubs, vegetables, roots, flowers, oils, wines, corn, and everything
that is there, and that thy heart can search out. All this is an image
of the heavenly pomp.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2607src" href=
"#xd21e2607" name="xd21e2607src">4</a></p>
<p>A despotic fiat could not suffice as an explanation of the origin of
Nature to Jacob B&ouml;hme; Nature appealed too strongly to his senses,
and lay too near his heart; hence he sought for a natural explanation
of Nature; but he necessarily found no other ground of explanation than
those qualities of Nature which made the strongest impression on him.
Jacob B&ouml;hme&mdash;this is his essential character&mdash;is a
mystical natural philosopher, a theosophic Vulcanist and
Neptunist,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2612src" href="#xd21e2612" name=
"xd21e2612src">5</a> for according to him &ldquo;all things had their
origin in fire and water.&rdquo; Nature had fascinated Jacob&rsquo;s
religious sentiments,&mdash;not in vain did he receive his mystical
light from the shining of tin utensils; but the religious sentiment
works only within itself; it has not the force, not the courage, to
press forward to the examination of things in their reality; it looks
at all things through the medium of religion, it sees all in God,
<i>i.e.</i>, in the entrancing, soul-possessing splendour of the
imagination, it sees all in images and as an image. But Nature affected
his mind in an opposite manner; hence he must place this opposition in
God himself,&mdash;for the supposition of two independently existing,
opposite, original principles would have afflicted his religious
sentiment;&mdash;he must distinguish in God himself a gentle,
beneficent element, and a fierce consuming one. Everything fiery,
bitter, harsh, contracting, dark, cold, comes from a divine harshness
and bitterness; everything mild, lustrous, warming, tender, soft,
yielding, from a mild, soft, luminous quality in God. &ldquo;Thus are
the creatures on the earth, in the water, and in the air, each creature
out of its own science, out of good and evil.... As one sees before
one&rsquo;s eyes that there are good and evil creatures; as venomous
beasts and serpents from the centre of the nature of darkness, from the
power of the fierce quality, which only want to dwell in darkness,
abiding in caves and hiding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>themselves from the sun. By each
animal&rsquo;s food and dwelling we see whence they have sprang, for
every creature needs to dwell with its mother, and yearns after her, as
is plain to the sight.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gold, silver, precious stones, and
all bright metal, has its origin in the light, which appeared before
the times of anger,&rdquo; &amp;c. &ldquo;Everything which in the
substance of this world is yielding, soft, and thin, is flowing, and
gives itself forth, and the ground and origin of it is in the eternal
Unity, for unity ever flows forth from itself; for in the nature of
things not dense, as water and air, we can understand no susceptibility
or pain, they being one in themselves.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2626src" href="#xd21e2626" name="xd21e2626src">6</a> In short,
heaven is as rich as the earth. Everything that is on this earth is in
heaven,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2629src" href="#xd21e2629" name=
"xd21e2629src">7</a> all that is in Nature is in God. But in the latter
it is divine, heavenly; in the former, earthly, visible, external,
material, but yet the same.&rdquo; &ldquo;When I write of trees, shrubs
and fruits, thou must not understand me of earthly things, such as are
in this world; for it is not my meaning that in heaven there grows a
dead, hard, wooden tree, or a stone of earthly qualities. No: my
meaning is heavenly and spiritual, but yet truthful and literal; thus,
I mean no other things than what I write in the letters of the
alphabet;&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, in heaven there are the same trees and
flowers, but the trees in heaven are the trees which bloom and exhale
in my imagination, without making coarse material impressions upon me;
the trees on earth are the trees which I perceive through my senses.
The distinction is the distinction between imagination and perception.
&ldquo;It is not my undertaking,&rdquo; says Jacob B&ouml;hme himself,
&ldquo;to describe the course of all stars, their place and name, or
how they have yearly their conjunction or opposition, or quadrate, or
the like,&mdash;what they do yearly and hourly,&mdash;which through
long years has been discovered by wise, skilful, ingenious men, by
diligent contemplation and observation, and deep thought and
calculation. I have not learned and studied these things, and leave
scholars to treat of them, but my undertaking is to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>write
according to the spirit and thought, not according to
sight.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2641src" href="#xd21e2641"
name="xd21e2641src">8</a></p>
<p>The doctrine of Nature in God aims, by naturalism, to establish
theism, especially the theism which regards the Supreme Being as a
personal being. But personal theism conceives God as a personal being,
separate from all material things; it excludes from him all
development, because that is nothing else than the self-separation of a
being from circumstances and conditions which do not correspond to its
true idea. And this does not take place in God, because in him
beginning, end, middle, are not to be distinguished,&mdash;because he
is at once what he is, is from the beginning what he is to be, what he
can be; he is the pure unity of existence and essence, reality and
idea, act and will. <i lang="la">Deus suum Esse est.</i> Herein theism
accords with the essence of religion. All religions, however positive
they may be, rest on abstraction; they are distinguished only in that
from which the abstraction is made. Even the Homeric gods, with all
their living strength and likeness to man, are abstract forms; they
have bodies, like men, but bodies from which the limitations and
difficulties of the human body are eliminated. The idea of a divine
being is essentially an abstracted, distilled idea. It is obvious that
this abstraction is no arbitrary one, but is determined by the
essential stand-point of man. As he is, as he thinks, so does he make
his abstraction.</p>
<p>The abstraction expresses a judgment,&mdash;an affirmative and a
negative one at the same time, praise and blame. What man praises and
approves, that is God to him;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2651src" href=
"#xd21e2651" name="xd21e2651src">9</a> what he blames, condemns, is the
non-divine. Religion is a <i>judgment</i>. The most essential condition
in religion&mdash;in the idea of the divine being&mdash;is accordingly
the discrimination of the praiseworthy from the blameworthy, of the
perfect from the imperfect; in a word, of the positive from the
negative. The cultus itself consists in nothing else than in the
continual renewal of the origin of religion&mdash;a solemnising of the
critical discrimination between the divine and the non-divine.</p>
<p>The Divine Being is the human being glorified by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>death of
abstraction; it is the departed spirit of man. In religion man frees
himself from the limits of life; he here lets fall what oppresses him,
obstructs him, affects him repulsively; God is the self-consciousness
of man freed from all discordant elements; man feels himself free,
happy, blessed in his religion, because he only here lives the life of
genius, and keeps holiday. The basis of the divine idea lies for him
outside of that idea itself; its truth lies in the prior
<i>judgment</i>, in the fact that all which he excludes from God is
previously judged by him to be non-divine, and what is non-divine to be
worthless, nothing. If he were to include the attaining of this idea in
the idea itself, it would lose its most essential significance, its
true value, its beatifying charm. The divine being is the pure
subjectivity of man, freed from all else, from everything objective,
having relation only to itself, enjoying only itself, reverencing only
itself&mdash;his most subjective, his inmost self. The process of
discrimination, the separating of the intelligent from the
non-intelligent, of personality from Nature, of the perfect from the
imperfect, necessarily therefore takes place in the subject, not in the
object, and the idea of God lies not at the beginning but at the end of
sensible existence, of the world, of Nature. &ldquo;Where Nature
ceases, God begins,&rdquo; because God is the <i lang="la">ne plus
ultra</i>, the last limit of abstraction. That from which I can no
longer abstract is God, the last thought which I am capable of
grasping&mdash;the last, <i>i.e.</i>, the highest. <i lang="la">Id quo
nihil majus cogitari potest, Deus est.</i> That this Omega of sensible
existence becomes an Alpha also, is easily comprehensible; but the
essential point is, that he is the Omega. The Alpha is primarily a
consequence; because God is the last or highest, he is also the first.
And this predicate&mdash;the first Being, has by no means immediately a
cosmogonic significance, but only implies the highest rank. The
creation in the Mosaic religion has for its end to secure to Jehovah
the predicate of the highest and first, the true and exclusive God in
opposition to idols.</p>
<p>The effort to establish the personality of God through Nature has
therefore at its foundation an illegitimate, profane mingling of
philosophy and religion, a complete absence of criticism and knowledge
concerning the genesis of the personal God. Where personality is held
the essential attribute of God, where it is said&mdash;an impersonal
God is no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>God; there personality is held to be in and by
itself the highest and most real thing, there it is presupposed that
everything which is not a person is dead, is nothing, that only
personal existence is real, absolute existence, is life and
truth&mdash;but Nature is impersonal, and is therefore a trivial thing.
The truth of personality rests only on the untruth of Nature. To
predicate personality of God is nothing else than to declare
personality as the absolute essence; but personality is only conceived
in distinction, in abstraction from Nature. Certainly a merely personal
God is an abstract God; but so he ought to be&mdash;that is involved in
the idea of him; for he is nothing else than the personal nature of man
positing itself out of all connection with the world, making itself
free from all dependence on nature. In the personality of God man
consecrates the supernaturalness, immortality, independence,
unlimitedness of his own personality.</p>
<p>In general, the need of a personal God has its foundation in this,
that only in the attribute of personality does the personal man meet
with himself, find himself. Substance, pure spirit, mere reason, does
not satisfy him, is too abstract for him, <i>i.e.</i>, does not express
himself, does not lead him back to himself. And man is content, happy,
only when he is with himself, with his own nature. Hence, the more
personal a man is, the stronger is his need of a personal God. The
free, abstract thinker knows nothing higher than freedom; he does not
need to attach it to a personal being; for him freedom in itself, as
such, is a real positive thing. A mathematical, astronomical mind, a
man of pure understanding, an objective man, who is not shut up in
himself, who feels free and happy only in the contemplation of
objective rational relations, in the reason which lies in things in
themselves&mdash;such a man will regard the substance of Spinoza, or
some similar idea, as his highest being, and be full of antipathy
towards a personal, <i>i.e.</i>, subjective God. Jacobi therefore was a
classic philosopher, because (in this respect, at least) he was
consistent, he was at unity with himself; as was his God, so was his
philosophy&mdash;personal, subjective. The personal God cannot be
established otherwise than as he is established by Jacobi and his
disciples. Personality is proved only in a personal manner.</p>
<p>Personality may be, nay, must be, founded on a natural <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>basis; but this natural basis is attained only
when I cease to grope in the darkness of mysticism, when I step forth
into the clear daylight of real Nature, and exchange the idea of the
personal God for the idea of personality in general. But into the idea
of the personal God, the positive idea of whom is liberated,
disembodied personality, released from the limiting force of Nature, to
smuggle again this very Nature, is as perverse as if I were to mix
Brunswick mum with the nectar of the gods, in order to give the
ethereal beverage a solid foundation. Certainly the ingredients of
animal blood are not to be derived from the celestial juice which
nourishes the gods. But the flower of sublimation arises only through
the evaporation of matter; why, then, wilt thou mix with the sublimate
that very matter from which thou hast disengaged it? Certainly, the
impersonal existence of Nature is not to be explained by the idea of
personality; but where personality is a truth, or, rather, the absolute
truth, Nature has no positive significance, and consequently no
positive basis. The literal creation out of nothing is here the only
sufficient ground of explanation; for it simply says this: Nature is
nothing;&mdash;and this precisely expresses the significance which
Nature has for absolute personality. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

dwellings. &ldquo;Their dwellings are altogether such as the dwellings

rooms, and sleeping chambers therein in great number, and
entrance-courts, and round about gardens, flowers, meadows, and

<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY OF PROVIDENCE, AND CREATION OUT OF
NOTHING.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Creation is the spoken word of God; the creative,
cosmogonic fiat is the tacit word, identical with the thought. To speak
is an act of the will; thus, creation is a product of the Will: as in
the Word of God man affirms the divinity of the human word, so in
creation he affirms the divinity of the Will: not, however, the will of
the reason, but the will of the imagination&mdash;the absolutely
subjective, unlimited will. The culminating point of the principle of
subjectivity is creation out of nothing.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2698src" href="#xd21e2698" name="xd21e2698src">1</a> As the
eternity of the world or of matter imports nothing further than the
essentiality of matter, so the creation of the world out of nothing
imports simply the non-essentiality, the nothingness of the world. The
commencement of a thing is immediately connected, in idea if not in
time, with its end. &ldquo;Lightly come, lightly go.&rdquo; The will
has called it into existence&mdash;the will calls it back again into
nothing. When? The time is indifferent: its existence or non-existence
depends only on the will. But this will is not its own will:&mdash;not
only because a thing cannot will its non-existence, but for the prior
reason that the world is itself destitute of will. Thus the nothingness
of the world expresses the power of the will. The will that it should
exist is, at the same time, the will&mdash;at least the possible
will&mdash;that it should not exist. The existence of the world is
therefore a momentary, arbitrary, unreliable, <i>i.e.</i>, unreal
existence.</p>
<p>Creation out of nothing is the highest expression of omnipotence:
but omnipotence is nothing else than subjectivity exempting itself from
all objective conditions and limitations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>and consecrating this
exemption as the highest power and reality: nothing else than the
ability to posit everything real as unreal&mdash;everything conceivable
as possible: nothing else than the power of the imagination, or of the
will as identical with the imagination, the power of
self-will.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2708src" href="#xd21e2708" name=
"xd21e2708src">2</a> The strongest and most characteristic expression
of subjective arbitrariness is, &ldquo;it has pleased;&rdquo;&mdash;the
phrase, &ldquo;it has pleased God to call the world of bodies and
spirits into existence,&rdquo; is the most undeniable proof that
individual subjectivity, individual arbitrariness, is regarded as the
highest essence&mdash;the omnipotent world-principle. On this ground,
creation out of nothing as a work of the Almighty Will falls into the
same category with miracle, or rather it is the first miracle, not only
in time but in rank also;&mdash;the principle of which all further
miracles are the spontaneous result. The proof of this is history
itself; all miracles have been vindicated, explained, and illustrated
by appeal to the omnipotence which created the world out of nothing.
Why should not He who made the world out of nothing, make wine out of
water, bring human speech from the mouth of an ass, and charm water out
of a rock? But miracle is, as we shall see further on, only a product
and object of the imagination, and hence creation out of nothing, as
the primitive miracle, is of the same character. For this reason the
doctrine of creation out of nothing has been pronounced a supernatural
one, to which reason of itself could not have attained; and in proof of
this, appeal has been made to the fact that the pagan philosophers
represented the world to have been formed by the Divine Reason out of
already existing matter. But this supernatural principle is no other
than the principle of subjectivity, which in Christianity exalted
itself to an unlimited, universal monarchy; whereas the ancient
philosophers were not subjective enough to regard the absolutely
subjective being as the exclusively absolute being, because they
limited subjectivity by the contemplation of the world or
reality&mdash;because to them the world was a truth.</p>
<p>Creation out of nothing, as identical with miracle, is one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>with Providence; for the idea of
Providence&mdash;originally, in its true religious significance, in
which it is not yet infringed upon and limited by the unbelieving
understanding&mdash;is one with the idea of miracle. The proof of
Providence is miracle.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2715src" href=
"#xd21e2715" name="xd21e2715src">3</a> Belief in Providence is belief
in a power to which all things stand at command to be used according to
its pleasure, in opposition to which all the power of reality is
nothing. Providence cancels the laws of Nature; it interrupts the
course of necessity, the iron bond which inevitably binds effects to
causes; in short, it is the same unlimited, all-powerful will, that
called the world into existence out of nothing. Miracle is a <i lang=
"la">creatio ex nihilo</i>. He who turns water into wine, makes wine
out of nothing, for the constituents of wine are not found in water;
otherwise, the production of wine would not be a miraculous, but a
natural act. The only attestation, the only proof of Providence is
miracle. Thus Providence is an expression of the same idea as creation
out of nothing. Creation out of nothing can only be understood and
explained in connection with Providence; for miracle properly implies
nothing more than that the miracle worker is the same as he who brought
forth all things by his mere will&mdash;God the Creator.</p>
<p>But Providence has relation essentially to man. It is for
man&rsquo;s sake that Providence makes of things whatever it pleases:
it is for man&rsquo;s sake that it supersedes the authority and reality
of a law otherwise omnipotent. The admiration of Providence in Nature,
especially in the animal kingdom, is nothing else than an admiration of
Nature, and therefore belongs merely to naturalism, though to a
religious naturalism;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2723src" href=
"#xd21e2723" name="xd21e2723src">4</a> for in Nature is revealed only
natural, not divine Providence&mdash;not Providence as it is an object
to religion. Religious Providence reveals itself only in
miracles&mdash;especially in the miracle of the Incarnation, the
central point of religion. But we nowhere read that God, for the sake
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>brutes, became a brute&mdash;the very idea of
this is, in the eyes of religion, impious and ungodly; or that God ever
performed a miracle for the sake of animals or plants. On the contrary,
we read that a poor fig-tree, because it bore no fruit at a time when
it could not bear it, was cursed, purely in order to give men an
example of the power of faith over Nature;&mdash;and again, that when
the tormenting devils were driven out of men, they were driven into
brutes. It is true we also read: &ldquo;No sparrow falls to the ground
without your Father;&rdquo; but these sparrows have no more worth and
importance than the hairs on the head of a man, which are all
numbered.</p>
<p>Apart from instinct, the brute has no other guardian spirit, no
other Providence, than its senses or its organs in general. A bird
which loses its eyes has lost its guardian angel; it necessarily goes
to destruction if no miracle happens. We read indeed that a raven
brought food to the prophet Elijah, but not (at least to my knowledge)
that an animal was supported by other than natural means. But if a man
believes that he also has no other Providence than the powers of his
race&mdash;his senses and understanding,&mdash;he is in the eyes of
religion, and of all those who speak the language of religion, an
irreligious man; because he believes only in a natural Providence, and
a natural Providence is in the eyes of religion as good as none. Hence
Providence has relation essentially to men, and even among men only to
the religious. &ldquo;God is the Saviour of all men, but especially of
them that believe.&rdquo; It belongs, like religion, only to man; it is
intended to express the essential distinction of man from the brute, to
rescue man from the tyranny of the forces of Nature. Jonah in the
whale, Daniel in the den of lions, are examples of the manner in which
Providence distinguishes (religious) men from brutes. If therefore the
Providence which manifests itself in the organs with which animals
catch and devour their prey, and which is so greatly admired by
Christian naturalists, is a truth, the Providence of the Bible, the
Providence of religion, is a falsehood; and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.
What pitiable and at the same time ludicrous hypocrisy is the attempt
to do homage to <i>both</i>, to Nature, and the Bible at once! How does
Nature contradict the Bible! How does the Bible contradict Nature! The
God of Nature reveals himself by giving to the lion strength and
appropriate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>organs in order that, for the preservation of
his life, he may in case of necessity kill and devour even a human
being; the God of the Bible reveals himself by interposing his own aid
to rescue the human being from the jaws of the lion!<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2738src" href="#xd21e2738" name="xd21e2738src">5</a></p>
<p>Providence is a privilege of man. It expresses the value of man, in
distinction from other natural beings and things; it exempts him from
the connection of the universe. Providence is the conviction of man of
the infinite value of his existence,&mdash;a conviction in which he
renounces faith in the reality of external things; it is the idealism
of religion. Faith in Providence is therefore identical with faith in
personal immortality; save only, that in the latter the infinite value
of existence is expressed in relation to time, as infinite duration. He
who prefers no special claims, who is indifferent about himself, who
identifies himself with the world, who sees himself as a part merged in
the whole,&mdash;such a one believes in no Providence, <i>i.e.</i>, in
no special Providence; but only special Providence is Providence in the
sense of religion. Faith in Providence is faith in one&rsquo;s own
worth, the faith of man in himself; hence the beneficent consequences
of this faith, but hence also false humility, religious arrogance,
which, it is true, does not rely on itself, but only because it commits
the care of itself to the blessed God. God concerns himself about me;
he has in view my happiness, my salvation; he wills that I shall be
blest; but that is my will also: thus, my interest is God&rsquo;s
interest, my own will is God&rsquo;s will, my own aim is God&rsquo;s
aim,&mdash;God&rsquo;s love for me nothing else than my self-love
deified. Thus when I believe in Providence, in what do I believe but in
the divine reality and significance of my own being?</p>
<p>But where Providence is believed in, belief in God is made dependent
on belief in Providence. He who denies that there is a Providence,
denies that there is a God, or&mdash;what is the same thing&mdash;that
God is God; for a God who is not the Providence of man, is a
contemptible God, a God who is wanting in the divinest, most adorable
attribute. Consequently, the belief in God is nothing but the belief in
human dignity,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2748src" href="#xd21e2748"
name="xd21e2748src">6</a> the belief in the absolute reality and
significance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>of the human nature. But belief in a (religious)
Providence is belief in creation out of nothing, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>; the latter, therefore, can have no other significance
than that of Providence as just developed, and it has actually no
other. Religion sufficiently expresses this by making man the end of
creation. All things exist, not for their own sake, but for the sake of
man. He who, like the pious Christian naturalists, pronounces this to
be pride, declares Christianity itself to be pride; for to say that the
material world exists for the sake of man, implies infinitely less than
to say that God&mdash;or at least, if we follow Paul, a being who is
almost God, scarcely to be distinguished from God&mdash;becomes man for
the sake of men.</p>
<p>But if man is the end of creation, he is also the true cause of
creation, for the end is the principle of action. The distinction
between man as the end of creation, and man as its cause, is only that
the cause is the latent, inner man, the essential man, whereas the end
is the self-evident, empirical, individual man,&mdash;that man
recognises himself as the end of creation, but not as the cause,
because he distinguishes the cause, the essence from himself as another
personal being.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2758src" href="#xd21e2758"
name="xd21e2758src">7</a> But this other being, this creative
principle, is in fact nothing else than his subjective nature separated
from the limits of individuality and materiality, <i>i.e.</i>, of
objectivity, unlimited will, personality posited out of all connection
with the world,&mdash;which by creation, <i>i.e.</i>, the positing of
the world, of objectivity, of another, as a dependent, finite,
non-essential existence, gives itself the certainty of its exclusive
reality. The point in question in the Creation is not the truth and
reality of the world, but the truth and reality of personality, of
subjectivity in distinction from the world. The point in question is
the personality of God; but the personality of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>God
is the personality of man freed from all the conditions and limitations
of Nature. Hence the fervent interest in the Creation, the horror of
all pantheistic cosmogonies. The Creation, like the idea of a personal
God in general, is not a scientific, but a personal matter; not an
object of the free intelligence, but of the feelings; for the point on
which it hinges is only the guarantee, the last conceivable proof and
demonstration of personality or subjectivity as an essence quite apart,
having nothing in common with Nature, a supra- and extra-mundane
entity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2775src" href="#xd21e2775" name=
"xd21e2775src">8</a></p>
<p>Man distinguishes himself from Nature. This distinction of his is
his God: the distinguishing of God from Nature is nothing else than the
distinguishing of man from Nature. The antithesis of pantheism and
personalism resolves itself into the question: Is the nature of man
transcendental or immanent, supranaturalistic or naturalistic? The
speculations and controversies concerning the personality or
impersonality of God are therefore fruitless, idle, uncritical, and
odious; for the speculatists, especially those who maintain the
personality, do not call the thing by the right name; they put the
light under a bushel. While they in truth speculate only concerning
themselves, only in the interest of their own instinct of
self-preservation; they yet will not allow that they are splitting
their brains only about themselves; they speculate under the delusion
that they are searching out the mysteries of another being. Pantheism
identifies man with Nature, whether with its visible appearance, or its
abstract essence. Personalism isolates, separates, him from Nature;
converts him from a part into the whole, into an absolute essence by
himself. This is the distinction. If, therefore, you would be clear on
these subjects, exchange your mystical, perverted anthropology, which
you call theology, for real anthropology, and speculate in the light of
consciousness and Nature concerning the difference or identity of the
human essence with the essence of Nature. You yourselves admit that the
essence of the pantheistical God is nothing but the essence of Nature.
Why, then, will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"
name="pb108">108</a>]</span>you only see the mote in the eyes of your
opponents, and not observe the very obvious beam in your own eyes? why
make yourselves an exception to a universally valid law? Admit that
your personal God is nothing else than your own personal nature, that
while you believe in and construct your supra- and extra-natural God,
you believe in and construct nothing else than the supra- and
extra-naturalism of your own self.</p>
<p>In the Creation, as everywhere else, the true principle is concealed
by the intermingling of universal, metaphysical, and even pantheistic
definitions. But one need only be attentive to the closer definitions
to convince oneself that the true principle of creation is the
self-affirmation of subjectivity in distinction from Nature. God
produces the world outside himself; at first it is only an idea, a
plan, a resolve; now it becomes an act, and therewith it steps forth
out of God as a distinct and, relatively at least, a self-subsistent
object. But just so subjectivity in general, which distinguishes itself
from the world, which takes itself for an essence distinct from the
world, posits the world out of itself as a separate existence, indeed,
this positing out of self, and the distinguishing of self, is one act.
When therefore the world is posited outside of God, God is posited by
himself, is distinguished from the world. What else then is God but
your subjective nature, when the world is separated from it?<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2785src" href="#xd21e2785" name="xd21e2785src">9</a>
It is true that when astute reflection intervenes, the distinction
between <i>extra</i> and <i>intra</i> is disavowed as a finite and
human (?) distinction. But to the disavowal by the understanding, which
in relation to religion is pure misunderstanding, no credit is due. If
it is meant seriously, it destroys the foundation of the religious
consciousness; it does away with the possibility, the very principle of
the creation, for this rests solely on the reality <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>of
the above-mentioned distinction. Moreover, the effect of the creation,
all its majesty for the feelings and the imagination, is quite lost, if
the production of the world out of God is not taken in the real sense.
What is it to make, to create, to produce, but to make that which in
the first instance is only subjective, and so far invisible,
non-existent, into something objective, perceptible, so that other
beings besides me may know and enjoy it, and thus to put something out
of myself, to make it distinct from myself? Where there is no reality
or possibility of an existence external to me, there can be no question
of making or creating. God is eternal, but the world had a
commencement; God was, when as yet the world was not; God is invisible,
not cognisable by the senses, but the world is visible, palpable,
material, and therefore outside of God; for how can the material as
such, body, matter, be in God? The world exists outside of God, in the
same sense in which a tree, an animal, the world in general, exists
outside of my conception, outside of myself, is an existence distinct
from subjectivity. Hence, only when such an external existence is
admitted, as it was by the older philosophers and theologians, have we
the genuine, unmixed doctrine of the religious consciousness. The
speculative theologians and philosophers of modern times, on the
contrary, foist in all sorts of pantheistic definitions, although they
deny the principle of pantheism; and the result of this process is
simply an absolutely self-contradictory, insupportable fabrication of
their own.</p>
<p>Thus the creation of the world expresses nothing else than
subjectivity, assuring itself of its own reality and infinity through
the consciousness that the world is created, is a product of will,
<i>i.e.</i>, a dependent, powerless, unsubstantial existence. The
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo; out of which the world was produced, is a still
inherent nothingness. When thou sayest the world was made out of
nothing, thou conceivest the world itself as nothing, thou clearest
away from thy head all the limits to thy imagination, to thy feelings,
to thy will, for the world is the limitation of thy will, of thy
desire; the world alone obstructs thy soul; it alone is the wall of
separation between thee and God,&mdash;thy beatified, perfected nature.
Thus, subjectively, thou annihilatest the world; thou thinkest God by
himself, <i>i.e.</i>, absolutely unlimited <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>subjectivity, the subjectivity or soul which
enjoys itself alone, which needs not the world, which knows nothing of
the painful bonds of matter. In the inmost depths of thy soul thou
wouldest rather there were no world, for where the world is, there is
matter, and where there is matter there is weight and resistance, space
and time, limitation and necessity. Nevertheless, there <i>is</i> a
world, there <i>is</i> matter. How dost thou escape from the dilemma of
this contradiction? How dost thou expel the world from thy
consciousness, that it may not disturb thee in the beatitude of the
unlimited soul? Only by making the world itself a product of will, by
giving it an arbitrary existence always hovering between existence and
non-existence, always awaiting its annihilation. Certainly the act of
creation does not suffice to explain the existence of the world or
matter (the two are not separable), but it is a total misconception to
demand this of it, for the fundamental idea of the creation is this:
there is to be no world, no matter; and hence its end is daily looked
forward to with longing. The world in its truth does not here exist at
all, it is regarded only as the obstruction, the limitation of
subjectivity; how could the world in its truth and reality be deduced
from a principle which denies the world?</p>
<p>In order to recognise the above developed significance of the
creation as the true one, it is only necessary seriously to consider
the fact, that the chief point in the creation is not the production of
earth and water, plants and animals, for which indeed there is no God,
but the production of personal beings&mdash;of spirits, according to
the ordinary phrase. God is the idea of personality as itself a person,
subjectivity existing in itself apart from the world, existing for self
alone, without wants, posited as absolute existence, the <i>me</i>
without a <i>thee</i>. But as absolute existence for self alone
contradicts the idea of true life, the idea of love; as
self-consciousness is essentially united with the consciousness of a
<i>thee</i>, as solitude cannot, at least in perpetuity, preserve
itself from tedium and uniformity; thought immediately proceeds from
the divine Being to other conscious beings, and expands the idea of
personality which was at first condensed in one being to a plurality of
persons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2832src" href="#xd21e2832" name=
"xd21e2832src">10</a> If the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>person is conceived physically, as
a real man, in which form he is a being with wants, he appears first at
the end of the physical world, when the conditions of his existence are
present,&mdash;as the goal of creation. If, on the other hand, man is
conceived abstractly as a person, as is the case in religious
speculation, this circuit is dispensed with, and the task is the direct
deduction of the person, <i>i.e.</i>, the self-demonstration, the
ultimate self-verification of the human personality. It is true that
the divine personality is distinguished in every possible way from the
human in order to veil their identity; but these distinctions are
either purely fantastic, or they are mere assertions, devices which
exhibit the invalidity of the attempted deduction. All positive grounds
of the creation reduce themselves only to the conditions, to the
grounds, which urge upon the <i>me</i> the consciousness of the
necessity of another personal being. Speculate as much as you will, you
will never derive your personality from God, if you have not beforehand
introduced it, if God himself be not already the idea of your
personality, your own subjective nature. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

true that religious naturalism, or the acknowledgment of the Divine in

the Mosaic, which was so friendly to animals. But it is by no means the

Christian, the religious Providence, is quite another than that which
clothes the lilies and feeds the ravens. The natural Providence lets a

however, has Christian mysticism declared the human nature to be the
creative principle, the ground of the world. &ldquo;Man, who, before
time was, existed in eternity, works with God all the works that God
wrought a thousand years ago, and now, after a thousand years, still
works.&rdquo; &ldquo;All creatures have sprung forth through

explained why all attempts of speculative theology and of its kindred
philosophy to make the transition from God to the world, or to derive
the world from God, have failed and must fail. Namely, because they are
fundamentally false, from being made in ignorance of the idea on which
the Creation really turns.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

not admissible to urge against this the omnipresence of God, the
existence of God in all things, or the existence of things in God. For,
apart from the consideration that the future destruction of the world
expresses clearly enough its existence outside of God, <i>i.e.</i>, its
non-divineness, God is in a <i>special</i> manner only in man; but I am
at home only where I am <i>specially</i> at home. &ldquo;Nowhere is God
properly God, but in the soul. In all creatures there is something of
God; but in the soul God exists completely, for it is his
resting-place.&rdquo;&mdash;Predigten etzlicher Lehrer, &amp;c., p. 19.
And the existence of things in God, especially where it has no
pantheistic significance, and any such is here excluded, is equally an
idea without reality, and does not express the special sentiments of
religion.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e2785src">&uarr;</a></p>

also the point where the Creation represents to us not only the Divine
power, but also the Divine love. &ldquo;Quia bonus est (Deus),
sumus&rdquo; (Augustin). In the beginning, before the world, God was
alone. &ldquo;Ante omnia Deus erat solus, ipsi sibi et mundus et locus
et omnia. Solus autem; quia nihil extrinsecus pr&aelig;ter ipsum&rdquo;
(Tertullian). But there is no higher happiness than to make another
happy, bliss lies in the act of imparting. And only joy, only love
imparts. Hence man conceives imparting love as the principle of
existence. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Extasis bono non sinit ipsum manere
in se ipso</span>&rdquo; (Dionysius A.). Everything positive
establishes, attests itself, only by itself. The divine love is the joy
of life, establishing itself, affirming itself. But the highest
self-consciousness of life, the supreme joy of life is the love which
confers happiness. God is the bliss of existence.&nbsp;<a class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CREATION IN JUDAISM.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The doctrine of the Creation sprang out of Judaism;
indeed, it is the characteristic, the fundamental doctrine of the
Jewish religion. The principle which lies at its foundation is,
however, not so much the principle of subjectivity as of egoism. The
doctrine of the Creation in its characteristic significance arises only
on that stand-point where man in practice makes Nature merely the
servant of his will and needs, and hence in thought also degrades it to
a mere machine, a product of the will. <i>Now</i> its existence is
intelligible to him, since he explains and interprets it out of
himself, in accordance with his own feelings and notions. The question,
Whence is Nature or the world? presupposes wonder that it exists, or
the question, Why does it exist? But this wonder, this question, arises
only where man has separated himself from Nature and made it a mere
object of will. The author of the Book of Wisdom says truly of the
heathens, that, &ldquo;for admiration of the beauty of the world they
did not raise themselves to the idea of the Creator.&rdquo; To him who
feels that Nature is lovely, it appears an end in itself, it has the
ground of its existence in itself: in him the question, Why does it
exist? does not arise. Nature and God are identified in his
consciousness, his perception, of the world. Nature, as it impresses
his senses, has indeed had an origin, has been produced, but not
created in the religious sense, is not an arbitrary product. And by
this origin he implies nothing evil; originating involves for him
nothing impure, undivine; he conceives his gods themselves as having
had an origin. The generative force is to him the primal force: he
posits, therefore, as the ground of Nature, a force of Nature,&mdash;a
real, present, visibly active force, as the ground of reality. Thus
does man think where his relation to the world is &aelig;sthetic or
theoretic (for the theoretic view was originally the &aelig;sthetic
view, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span><i>prima philosophia</i>), where the idea of the
world is to him the idea of the cosmos, of majesty, of deity itself.
Only where such a theory was the fundamental principle could there be
conceived and expressed such a thought as that of Anaxagoras:&mdash;Man
is born to behold the world.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2866src" href=
"#xd21e2866" name="xd21e2866src">1</a> The standpoint of theory is the
standpoint of harmony with the world. The subjective activity, that in
which man contents himself, allows himself free play, is here the
sensuous imagination alone. Satisfied with this, he lets Nature subsist
in peace, and constructs his castles in the air, his poetical
cosmogonies, only out of natural materials. When, on the contrary, man
places himself only on the practical standpoint and looks at the world
from thence, making the practical standpoint the theoretical one also,
he is in disunion with Nature; he makes Nature the abject vassal of his
selfish interest, of his practical egoism. The theoretic expression of
this egoistical, practical view, according to which Nature is in itself
nothing, is this: Nature or the world is made, created, the product of
a command. God said, Let the world be, and straightway the world
presented itself at his bidding.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2872src"
href="#xd21e2872" name="xd21e2872src">2</a></p>
<p>Utilism is the essential theory of Judaism. The belief in a special
Divine Providence is the characteristic belief of Judaism; belief in
Providence is belief in miracle; but belief in miracle exists where
Nature is regarded only as an object of arbitrariness, of egoism, which
uses Nature only as an instrument of its own will and pleasure. Water
divides or rolls itself together like a firm mass, dust is changed into
lice, a staff into a serpent, rivers into blood, a rock into a
fountain; in the same place it is both light and dark at once, the sun
now stands still, now goes backward. And all these contradictions of
Nature happen for the welfare of Israel, purely at the command of
Jehovah, who troubles himself about nothing but Israel, who is nothing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>but the personified selfishness of the
Israelitish people, to the exclusion of all other
nations,&mdash;absolute intolerance, the secret essence of
monotheism.</p>
<p>The Greeks looked at Nature with the theoretic sense; they heard
heavenly music in the harmonious course of the stars; they saw Nature
rise from the foam of the all-producing ocean as Venus Anadyomene. The
Israelites, on the contrary, opened to Nature only the gastric sense;
their taste for Nature lay only in the palate; their consciousness of
God in eating manna. The Greek addicted himself to polite studies, to
the fine arts, to philosophy; the Israelite did not rise above the
alimentary view of theology. &ldquo;At even ye shall eat flesh, and in
the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am
the Lord your God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2896src" href=
"#xd21e2896" name="xd21e2896src">3</a> &ldquo;And Jacob vowed a vow,
saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go,
and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, so that I come
again to my father&rsquo;s house in peace, then shall the Lord be my
God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2901src" href="#xd21e2901" name=
"xd21e2901src">4</a> Eating is the most solemn act or the initiation of
the Jewish religion. In eating, the Israelite celebrates and renews the
act of creation; in eating, man declares Nature to be an insignificant
object. When the seventy elders ascended the mountain with Moses,
&ldquo;they saw God; and when they had seen God, they ate and
drank.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2906src" href="#xd21e2906"
name="xd21e2906src">5</a> Thus with them what the sight of the Supreme
Being heightened was the appetite for food.</p>
<p>The Jews have maintained their peculiarity to this day. Their
principle, their God, is the most practical principle in the
world,&mdash;namely, egoism; and moreover egoism in the form of
religion. Egoism is the God who will not let his servants come to
shame. Egoism is essentially monotheistic, for it has only one, only
self, as its end. Egoism strengthens cohesion, concentrates man on
himself, gives him a consistent principle of life; but it makes him
theoretically narrow, because indifferent to all which does not relate
to the well-being of self. Hence science, like art, arises only out of
polytheism, for polytheism is the frank, open, unenvying sense of all
that is beautiful and good without distinction, the sense of the world,
of the universe. The Greeks looked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>abroad into the wide world
that they might extend their sphere of vision; the Jews to this day
pray with their faces turned towards Jerusalem. In the Israelites,
monotheistic egoism excluded the free theoretic tendency. Solomon, it
is true, surpassed &ldquo;all the children of the East&rdquo; in
understanding and wisdom, and spoke (treated, <i lang="la">agebat</i>)
moreover &ldquo;of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon, even unto
the hyssop that springeth out of the wall,&rdquo; and also of
&ldquo;beasts and of fowl, and of creeping things and of fishes&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd21e48" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kgs%204:30-34">1
Kings iv. 30, 34</a>). But it must be added that Solomon did not serve
Jehovah with his whole heart; he did homage to strange gods and strange
women; and thus he had the polytheistic sentiment and taste. The
polytheistic sentiment, I repeat, is the foundation of science and
art.</p>
<p>The significance which Nature in general had for the Hebrews is one
with their idea of its origin. The mode in which the genesis of a thing
is explained is the candid expression of opinion, of sentiment
respecting it. If it be thought meanly of, so also is its origin. Men
used to suppose that insects, vermin, sprang from carrion and other
rubbish. It was not because they derived vermin from so uninviting a
source that they thought contemptuously of them, but, on the contrary,
because they thought thus, because the nature of vermin appeared to
them so vile, they imagined an origin corresponding to this nature, a
vile origin. To the Jews Nature was a mere means towards achieving the
end of egoism, a mere object of will. But the ideal, the idol of the
egoistic will is that Will which has unlimited command, which requires
no means in order to attain its end, to realise its object, which
immediately by itself, <i>i.e.</i>, by pure will, calls into existence
whatever it pleases. It pains the egoist that the satisfaction of his
wishes and need is only to be attained immediately, that for him there
is a chasm between the wish and its realisation, between the object in
the imagination and the object in reality. Hence, in order to relieve
this pain, to make himself free from the limits of reality, he supposes
as the true, the highest being, One who brings forth an object by the
mere <span class="sc">I will</span>. For this reason, Nature, the
world, was to the Hebrews the product of a dictatorial word, of a
categorical imperative, of a magic fiat.</p>
<p>To that which has no essential existence for me in theory
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>I assign no theoretic, no positive ground. By
referring it to Will I only enforce its theoretic nullity. What we
despise we do not honour with a glance: that which is observed has
importance: contemplation is respect. Whatever is looked at fetters by
secret forces of attraction, overpowers by the spell which it exercises
upon the eye, the criminal arrogance of that Will which seeks only to
subject all things to itself. Whatever makes an impression on the
theoretic sense, on the reason, withdraws itself from the dominion of
the egoistic Will: it reacts, it presents resistance. That which
devastating egoism devotes to death, benignant theory restores to
life.</p>
<p>The much-belied doctrine of the heathen philosophers concerning the
eternity of matter, or the world, thus implies nothing more than that
Nature was to them a theoretic reality.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2935src" href="#xd21e2935" name="xd21e2935src">6</a> The heathens
were idolaters, that is, they contemplated Nature; they did nothing
else than what the profoundly Christian nations do at this day when
they make Nature an object of their admiration, of their indefatigable
investigation. &ldquo;But the heathens actually worshipped natural
objects.&rdquo; Certainly; for worship is only the childish, the
religious form of contemplation. Contemplation and worship are not
essentially distinguished. That which I contemplate I humble myself
before, I consecrate to it my noblest possession, my heart, my
intelligence, as an offering. The natural philosopher also falls on his
knees before Nature when, at the risk of his life, he snatches from
some precipice a lichen, an insect, or a stone, to glorify it in the
light of contemplation, and give it an eternal existence in the memory
of scientific humanity. The study of Nature is the worship of
Nature&mdash;idolatry in the sense of the Israelitish and Christian
God; and idolatry is simply man&rsquo;s primitive contemplation of
Nature; for religion is nothing else than man&rsquo;s primitive, and
therefore childish, popular, but prejudiced, unemancipated
consciousness of himself and of Nature. The Hebrews, on the other hand,
raised themselves from the worship of idols to the worship of God, from
the creature to the Creator; <i>i.e.</i>, they raised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>themselves from the theoretic view of Nature,
which fascinated the idolaters, to the purely practical view which
subjects Nature only to the ends of egoism. &ldquo;And lest thou lift
up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, the moon, and
the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship
them and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto
(<i>i.e.</i>, bestowed upon, <i>largitus est</i>) all nations under the
whole heaven.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2953src" href=
"#xd21e2953" name="xd21e2953src">7</a> Thus the creation out of
nothing, <i>i.e.</i>, the creation as a purely imperious act, had its
origin only in the unfathomable depth of Hebrew egoism.</p>
<p>On this ground, also, the creation out of nothing is no object of
philosophy;&mdash;at least in any other way than it is so
here;&mdash;for it cuts away the root of all true speculation, presents
no grappling-point to thought, to theory; theoretically considered, it
is a baseless air-built doctrine, which originated solely in the need
to give a warrant to utilism, to egoism, which contains and expresses
nothing but the command to make Nature&mdash;not an object of thought,
of contemplation, but&mdash;an object of utilisation. The more empty it
is, however, for natural philosophy, the more profound is its
&ldquo;speculative&rdquo; significance; for just because it has no
theoretic fulcrum, it allows to the speculatist infinite room for the
play of arbitrary, groundless interpretation.</p>
<p>It is in the history of dogma and speculation as in the history of
states. World-old usages, laws, and institutions continue to drag out
their existence long after they have lost their true meaning. What has
once existed will not be denied the right to exist for ever; what was
once good, claims to be good for all times. At this period of
superannuation come the interpreters, the speculatists, and talk of the
profound sense, because they no longer know the true one.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2965src" href="#xd21e2965" name="xd21e2965src">8</a>
Thus religious speculation deals with the dogmas torn from the
connection in which alone they have any <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>true meaning; instead
of tracing them back critically to their true origin, it makes the
secondary primitive, and the primitive secondary. To it God is the
first, man the second. Thus it inverts the natural order of things. In
reality, the first is man, the second the nature of man made objective,
namely, God. Only in later times, in which religion is already become
flesh and blood, can it be said&mdash;As God is, so is man; although,
indeed, this proposition never amounts to anything more than tautology.
But in the origin of religion it is otherwise; and it is only in the
origin of a thing that we can discern its true nature. Man first
unconsciously and involuntarily creates God in his own image, and after
this God consciously and voluntarily creates man in his own image. This
is especially confirmed by the development of the Israelitish religion.
Hence the position of theological one-sidedness, that the revelation of
God holds an even pace with the development of the human race.
Naturally; for the revelation of God is nothing else than the
revelation, the self-unfolding of human nature. The supranaturalistic
egoism of the Jews did not proceed from the Creator, but conversely,
the latter from the former; in the creation the Israelite justified his
egoism at the bar of his reason.</p>
<p>It is true, and it may be readily understood on simply practical
grounds, that even the Israelite could not, as a man, withdraw himself
from the theoretic contemplation and admiration of Nature. But in
celebrating the power and greatness of Nature, he celebrates only the
power and greatness of Jehovah. And the power of Jehovah has exhibited
itself with the most glory in the miracles which it has wrought in
favour of Israel. Hence, in the celebration of this power, the
Israelite has always reference ultimately to himself; he extols the
greatness of Nature only for the same reason that the conqueror
magnifies the strength of his opponent, in order thereby to heighten
his own self-complacency, to make his own fame more illustrious. Great
and mighty is Nature, which Jehovah has created, but yet mightier, yet
greater, is Israel&rsquo;s self-estimation. For his sake the sun stands
still; for his sake, according to Philo, the earth quaked at the
delivery of the law; in short, for his sake all Nature alters its
course. &ldquo;For the whole creature in his proper kind was fashioned
again anew, serving the peculiar commandments that were given unto
them, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>thy children might be kept without
hurt.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2975src" href="#xd21e2975"
name="xd21e2975src">9</a> According to Philo, God gave Moses power over
the whole of Nature; all the elements obeyed him as the Lord of
Nature.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2978src" href="#xd21e2978" name=
"xd21e2978src">10</a> Israel&rsquo;s requirement is the omnipotent law
of the world, Israel&rsquo;s need the fate of the universe. Jehovah is
Israel&rsquo;s consciousness of the sacredness and necessity of his own
existence,&mdash;a necessity before which the existence of Nature, the
existence of other nations, vanishes into nothing; Jehovah is the
<i>salus populi</i>, the salvation of Israel, to which everything that
stands in its way must be sacrificed; Jehovah is exclusive, monarchical
arrogance, the annihilating flash of anger in the vindictive glance of
destroying Israel; in a word, Jehovah is the <i>ego</i> of Israel,
which regards itself as the end and aim, the Lord of Nature. Thus, in
the power of Nature the Israelite celebrates the power of Jehovah, and
in the power of Jehovah the power of his own self-consciousness.
&ldquo;Blessed be God! God is our help, God is our
salvation.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Jehovah is my
strength.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God himself hearkened to the word of
Joshua, for Jehovah himself fought for
Israel.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Jehovah is a God of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If, in the course of time, the idea of Jehovah expanded itself in
individual minds, and his love was extended, as by the writer of the
Book of Jonah, to man in general, this does not belong to the essential
character of the Israelitish religion. The God of the fathers, to whom
the most precious recollections are attached, the ancient historical
God, remains always the foundation of a religion.<a class="noteref" id=

<h2 class="main">THE OMNIPOTENCE OF FEELING, OR THE MYSTERY OF
PRAYER.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Israel is the historical definition of the specific
nature of the religious consciousness, save only that here this
consciousness was circumscribed by the limits of a particular, a
national interest. Hence, we need only let these limits fall, and we
have the Christian religion. Judaism is worldly Christianity;
Christianity, spiritual Judaism. The Christian religion is the Jewish
religion purified from national egoism, and yet at the same time it is
certainly another, a new religion; for every reformation, every
purification, produces&mdash;especially in religious matters, where
even the trivial becomes important&mdash;an essential change. To the
Jew, the Israelite was the mediator, the bond between God and man; in
his relation to Jehovah he relied on his character of Israelite;
Jehovah himself was nothing else than the self-consciousness of Israel
made objective as the absolute being, the national conscience, the
universal law, the central point of the political system.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3010src" href="#xd21e3010" name="xd21e3010src">1</a>
If we let fall the limits of nationality, we obtain&mdash;instead of
the Israelite&mdash;<i>man</i>. As in Jehovah the Israelite personified
his national existence, so in God the Christian personified his
subjective human nature, freed from the limits of nationality. As
Israel made the wants of his national existence the law of the world,
as, under the dominance of these wants, he deified even his political
vindictiveness; so the Christian made the requirements of human feeling
the absolute powers and laws of the world. The miracles of
Christianity, which belong just as essentially to its characterisation
as the miracles of the Old Testament to that of Judaism, have not the
welfare of a nation for their object, but the welfare of
man:&mdash;that is, indeed, only of man considered as Christian; for
Christianity, in contradiction with the genuine universal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>human heart, recognised man only under the
condition, the limitation, of belief in Christ. But this fatal
limitation will be discussed further on. Christianity has spiritualised
the egoism of Judaism into subjectivity (though even within
Christianity this subjectivity is again expressed as pure egoism), has
changed the desire for earthly happiness, the goal of the Israelitish
religion, into the longing for heavenly bliss, which is the goal of
Christianity.</p>
<p>The highest idea, the God of a political community, of a people
whose political system expresses itself in the form of religion, is
Law, the consciousness of the law as an absolute divine power; the
highest idea, the God of unpolitical, unworldly feeling is Love; the
love which brings all the treasures and glories in heaven and upon
earth as an offering to the beloved, the love whose law is the wish of
the beloved one, and whose power is the unlimited power of the
imagination, of intellectual miracle-working.</p>
<p>God is the Love that satisfies our wishes, our emotional wants; he
is himself the realised wish of the heart, the wish exalted to the
certainty of its fulfilment, of its reality, to that undoubting
certainty before which no contradiction of the understanding, no
difficulty of experience or of the external world, maintains its
ground. Certainty is the highest power for man; that which is certain
to him is the essential, the divine. &ldquo;God is love:&rdquo; this,
the supreme dictum of Christianity, only expresses the certainty which
human feeling has of itself, as the alone essential, <i>i.e.</i>,
absolute divine power, the certainty that the inmost wishes of the
heart have objective validity and reality, that there are no limits, no
positive obstacles to human feeling, that the whole world, with all its
pomp and glory, is nothing weighed against human feeling. God is love:
that is, feeling is the God of man, nay, God absolutely, the Absolute
Being. God is the nature of human feeling, unlimited, pure feeling,
made objective. God is the optative of the human heart transformed into
the <i>tempus finitum</i>, the certain, blissful &ldquo;<span class=
"sc">IS</span>,&rdquo;&mdash;the unrestricted omnipotence of feeling,
prayer hearing itself, feeling perceiving itself, the echo of our cry
of anguish. Pain must give itself utterance; involuntarily the artist
seizes the lute that he may breathe out his sufferings in its tones. He
soothes his sorrow by making it audible to himself, by making it
objective; he lightens the burden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122"
href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>which weighs upon his heart
by communicating it to the air, by making his sorrow a general
existence. But nature listens not to the plaints of man, it is callous
to his sorrows. Hence man turns away from Nature, from all visible
objects. He turns within, that here, sheltered and hidden from the
inexorable powers, he may find audience for his griefs. Here he utters
his oppressive secrets; here he gives vent to his stifled sighs. This
open-air of the heart, this outspoken secret, this uttered sorrow of
the soul, is God. God is a tear of love, shed in the deepest
concealment over human misery. &ldquo;God is an unutterable sigh, lying
in the depths of the heart;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3033src"
href="#xd21e3033" name="xd21e3033src">2</a> this saying is the most
remarkable, the profoundest, truest expression of Christian
mysticism.</p>
<p>The ultimate essence of religion is revealed by the simplest act of
religion&mdash;prayer; an act which implies at least as much as the
dogma of the Incarnation, although religious speculation stands amazed
at this, as the greatest of mysteries. Not, certainly, the prayer
before and after meals, the ritual of animal egoism, but the prayer
pregnant with sorrow, the prayer of disconsolate love, the prayer which
expresses the power of the heart that crushes man to the ground, the
prayer which begins in despair and ends in rapture.</p>
<p>In prayer, man addresses God with the word of intimate
affection&mdash;<i>Thou</i>; he thus declares articulately that God is
his <i>alter ego</i>; he confesses to God, as the being nearest to him,
his most secret thoughts, his deepest wishes, which otherwise he
shrinks from uttering. But he expresses these wishes in the confidence,
in the certainty that they will be fulfilled. How could he apply to a
being that had no ear for his complaints? Thus what is prayer but the
wish of the heart expressed with confidence in its fulfilment?<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3046src" href="#xd21e3046" name="xd21e3046src">3</a>
what else is the being that fulfils these wishes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>but
human affection, the human soul, giving ear to itself, approving
itself, unhesitatingly affirming itself? The man who does not exclude
from his mind the idea of the world, the idea that everything here must
be sought intermediately, that every effect has its natural cause, that
a wish is only to be attained when it is made an end and the
corresponding means are put into operation&mdash;such a man does not
pray: he only works; he transforms his attainable wishes into objects
of real activity; other wishes which he recognises as purely subjective
he denies, or regards as simply subjective, pious aspirations. In other
words, he limits, he conditionates his being by the world, as a member
of which he conceives himself; he bounds his wishes by the idea of
necessity. In prayer, on the contrary, man excludes from his mind the
world, and with it all thoughts of intermediateness and dependence; he
makes his wishes&mdash;the concerns of his heart, objects of the
independent, omnipotent, absolute being, <i>i.e.</i>, he affirms them
without limitation. God is the affirmation<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3062src" href="#xd21e3062" name="xd21e3062src">4</a> of human
feeling; prayer is the unconditional confidence of human feeling in the
absolute identity of the subjective and objective, the certainty that
the power of the heart is greater than the power of Nature, that the
heart&rsquo;s need is absolute necessity, the fate of the world. Prayer
alters the course of Nature; it determines God to bring forth an effect
in contradiction with the laws of Nature. Prayer is the absolute
relation of the human heart to itself, to its own nature; in prayer,
man forgets that there exists a limit to his wishes, and is happy in
this forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Prayer is the self-division of man into two beings,&mdash;a dialogue
of man with himself, with his heart. It is essential to the
effectiveness of prayer that it be audibly, intelligibly, energetically
expressed. Involuntarily prayer wells forth in sound; the struggling
heart bursts the barrier of the closed lips. But audible prayer is only
prayer revealing its nature; prayer is virtually, if not actually,
speech,&mdash;the Latin word <i>oratio</i> signifies both: in prayer,
man speaks undisguisedly of that which weighs upon him, which affects
him closely; he makes his heart objective;&mdash;hence the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>moral power of prayer. Concentration, it is
said, is the condition of prayer; but it is more than a condition;
prayer is itself concentration,&mdash;the dismissal of all distracting
ideas, of all disturbing influences from without, retirement within
oneself, in order to have relation only with one&rsquo;s own being.
Only a trusting, open, hearty, fervent prayer is said to help; but this
help lies in the prayer itself. As everywhere in religion the
subjective, the secondary, the conditionating, is the <i lang=
"la">prima causa</i>, the objective fact; so here, these subjective
qualities are the objective nature of prayer itself.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3075src" href="#xd21e3075" name="xd21e3075src">5</a></p>
<p>It is an extremely superficial view of prayer to regard it as an
expression of the sense of dependence. It certainly expresses such a
sense, but the dependence is that of man on his own heart, on his own
feeling. He who feels himself only dependent, does not open his mouth
in prayer; the sense of dependence robs him of the desire, the courage
for it, for the sense of dependence is the sense of need. Prayer has
its root rather in the unconditional trust of the heart, untroubled by
all thought of compulsive need, that its concerns are objects of the
Absolute Being, that the almighty, infinite nature of the Father of men
is a sympathetic, tender, loving nature, and that thus the dearest,
most sacred emotions of man are divine realities. But the child does
not feel itself dependent on the father as a father; rather, he has in
the father the feeling of his own strength, the consciousness of his
own worth, the guarantee of his existence, the certainty of the
fulfilment of his wishes; on the father rests the burden of care; the
child, on the contrary, lives careless and happy in reliance on the
father, his visible guardian spirit, who desires nothing but the
child&rsquo;s welfare and happiness. The father makes the child an end,
and himself the means of its existence. The child, in asking something
of its father, does not apply to him as a being distinct from itself, a
master, a person in general, but it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>applies to him in so
far as he is dependent on, and determined by his paternal feeling, his
love for his child.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3088src" href=
"#xd21e3088" name="xd21e3088src">6</a> The entreaty is only an
expression of the force which the child exercises over the father; if,
indeed, the word force is appropriate here, since the force of the
child is nothing more than the force of the father&rsquo;s own heart.
Speech has the same form both for entreaty and command, namely, the
imperative. And the imperative of love has infinitely more power than
that of despotism. Love does not command; love needs but gently to
intimate its wishes to be certain of their fulfilment; the despot must
throw compulsion even into the tones of his voice in order to make
other beings, in themselves uncaring for him, the executors of his
wishes. The imperative of love works with electro-magnetic power; that
of despotism with the mechanical power of a wooden telegraph. The most
intimate epithet of God in prayer is the word &ldquo;Father;&rdquo; the
most intimate, because in it man is in relation to the absolute nature
as to his own; the word &ldquo;Father&rdquo; is the expression of the
closest, the most intense identity,&mdash;the expression in which lies
the pledge that my wishes will be fulfilled, the guarantee of my
salvation. The omnipotence to which man turns in prayer is nothing but
the Omnipotence of Goodness, which, for the sake of the salvation of
man, makes the impossible possible;&mdash;is, in truth, nothing else
than the omnipotence of the heart, of feeling, which breaks through all
the limits of the understanding, which soars above all the boundaries
of Nature, which wills that there be nothing else than feeling, nothing
that contradicts the heart. Faith in omnipotence is faith in the
unreality of the external world, of objectivity,&mdash;faith in the
absolute reality of man&rsquo;s emotional nature: the essence of
omnipotence is simply the essence of feeling. Omnipotence is the power
before which no law, no external condition, avails or subsists; but
this power is the emotional nature, which feels every determination,
every law, to be a limit, a restraint, and for that reason dismisses
it. Omnipotence does nothing more than accomplish the will of the
feelings. In prayer man turns to the Omnipotence of
Goodness;&mdash;which simply means, that in prayer man adores his own
heart, regards his own feelings as absolute. <span class=

be an imbecile objection to say that God fulfils only those wishes,
those prayers, which are uttered in his name, or in the interest of the
Church of Christ, in short, only the wishes which are accordant with
his will; for the will of God is the will of man, or rather God has the
power, man the will: God makes men happy, but man wills that he may be
happy. A particular wish may not be granted; but that is of no
consequence, if only the species, the essential tendency is accepted.
The pious soul whose prayer has failed consoles himself, therefore, by
thinking that its fulfilment would not have been salutary for him.

<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY OF FAITH&mdash;THE MYSTERY OF
MIRACLE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Faith in the power of prayer&mdash;and only where a
power, an objective power, is ascribed to it, is prayer still a
religious truth&mdash;is identical with faith in miraculous power; and
faith in miracles is identical with the essence of faith in general.
Faith alone prays; the prayer of faith is alone effectual. But faith is
nothing else than confidence in the reality of the subjective in
opposition to the limitations or laws of Nature and reason,&mdash;that
is, of natural reason. The specific object of faith, therefore, is
miracle; faith is the belief in miracle; faith and miracle are
absolutely inseparable. That which is objectively miracle or miraculous
power is subjectively faith; miracle is the outward aspect of faith,
faith the inward soul of miracle; faith is the miracle of mind, the
miracle of feeling, which merely becomes objective in external
miracles. To faith nothing is impossible, and miracle only gives
actuality to this omnipotence of faith: miracles are but a visible
example of what faith can effect. Unlimitedness, supernaturalness,
exaltation of feeling,&mdash;transcendence is therefore the essence of
faith. Faith has reference only to things which, in contradiction with
the limits or laws of Nature and reason, give objective reality to
human feelings and human desires. Faith unfetters the wishes of
subjectivity from the bonds of natural reason; it confers what Nature
and reason deny; hence it makes man happy, for it satisfies his most
personal wishes. And true faith is discomposed by no doubt. Doubt
arises only where I go out of myself, overstep the bounds of my
personality, concede reality and a right of suffrage to that which is
distinct from myself;&mdash;where I know myself to be a subjective,
i.e., a limited being, and seek to widen my limits by admitting things
external to myself. But in faith the very principle of doubt is
annulled; for to faith the subjective is in and by itself the
objective&mdash;nay, the absolute. Faith is nothing else than belief in
the absolute reality of subjectivity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Faith is that courage in the heart
which trusts for all good to God. Such a faith, in which the heart
places its reliance on God alone, is enjoined by God in the first
commandment, where he says, I am the Lord thy God.... That is, I alone
will be thy God; thou shalt seek no other God; I will help thee out of
all trouble. Thou shalt not think that I am an enemy to thee, and will
not help thee. When thou thinkest so, thou makest me in thine heart
into another God than I am. Wherefore hold it for certain that I am
willing to be merciful to thee.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;As thou behavest
thyself, so does God behave. If thou thinkest that he is angry with
thee, he is angry; if thou thinkest that he is unmerciful and will cast
thee into hell, he is so. As thou believest of God, so is he to
thee.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If thou believest it, thou hast it; but if
thou believest not, thou hast none of
it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Therefore, as we believe so does it happen to
us. If we regard him as our God, he will not be our devil. But if we
regard him not as our God, then truly he is not our God, but must be a
consuming fire.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;By unbelief we make God a
devil.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3106src" href="#xd21e3106"
name="xd21e3106src">1</a> Thus, if I believe in a God, I have a God,
<i>i.e.</i>, faith in God is the God of man. If God is such, whatever
it may be, as I believe him, what else is the nature of God than the
nature of faith? Is it possible for thee to believe in a God who
regards thee favourably, if thou dost not regard thyself favourably, if
thou despairest of man, if he is nothing to thee? What else then is the
being of God but the being of man, the absolute self-love of man? If
thou believest that God is for thee, thou believest that nothing is or
can be against thee, that nothing contradicts thee. But if thou
believest that nothing is or can be against thee, thou
believest&mdash;what?&mdash;nothing less than that thou art
God.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3112src" href="#xd21e3112" name=
"xd21e3112src">2</a> That God is another being is only illusion, only
imagination. In declaring that God is for thee, thou declarest that he
is thy own being. What then is faith but the infinite self-certainty of
man, the undoubting certainty that his own subjective being is the
objective, absolute being, the being of beings? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>Faith does not limit itself by the idea of a world, a universe, a
necessity. For faith there is nothing but God, <i>i.e.</i>, limitless
subjectivity. Where faith rises the world sinks, nay, has already sunk
into nothing. Faith in the real annihilation of the world&mdash;in an
immediately approaching, a mentally present annihilation of this world,
a world antagonistic to the wishes of the Christian, is therefore a
phenomenon belonging to the inmost essence of Christianity; a faith
which is not properly separable from the other elements of Christian
belief, and with the renunciation of which, true, positive Christianity
is renounced and denied.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3124src" href=
"#xd21e3124" name="xd21e3124src">3</a> The essence of faith, as may be
confirmed by an examination of its objects down to the minutest
speciality, is the idea that that which man wishes actually is: he
wishes to be immortal, therefore he is immortal; he wishes for the
existence of a being who can do everything which is impossible to
Nature and reason, therefore such a being exists; he wishes for a world
which corresponds to the desires of the heart, a world of unlimited
subjectivity, <i>i.e.</i>, of unperturbed feeling, of uninterrupted
bliss, while nevertheless there exists a world the opposite of that
subjective one, and hence this world must pass away,&mdash;as
necessarily pass away as God, or absolute subjectivity, must remain.
Faith, love, hope, are the Christian Trinity. Hope has relation to the
fulfilment of the promises, the wishes which are not yet fulfilled, but
which are to be fulfilled; love has relation to the Being who gives and
fulfils these promises; faith to the promises, the wishes, which are
already fulfilled, which are historical facts.</p>
<p>Miracle is an essential object of Christianity, an essential article
of faith. But what is miracle? A supranaturalistic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>wish
realised&mdash;nothing more. The Apostle Paul illustrates the nature of
Christian faith by the example of Abraham. Abraham could not, in a
natural way, ever hope for posterity; Jehovah nevertheless promised it
to him out of special favour, and Abraham believed in spite of Nature.
Hence this faith was reckoned to him as righteousness, as merit; for it
implies great force of subjectivity to accept as certain something in
contradiction with experience, at least with rational, normal
experience. But what was the object of this divine promise? Posterity,
the object of a human wish. And in what did Abraham believe when he
believed in Jehovah? In a Being who can do everything, and can fulfil
all wishes. &ldquo;Is anything too hard for the Lord?&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3143src" href="#xd21e3143" name=
"xd21e3143src">4</a></p>
<p>But why do we go so far back as to Abraham? We have the most
striking examples much nearer to us. Miracle feeds the hungry, cures
men born blind, deaf, and lame, rescues from fatal diseases, and even
raises the dead at the prayer of relatives. Thus it satisfies human
wishes, and wishes which, though not always intrinsically like the wish
for the restoration of the dead, yet in so far as they appeal to
miraculous power, to miraculous aid, are transcendental,
supranaturalistic. But miracle is distinguished from that mode of
satisfying human wishes and needs which is in accordance with Nature
and reason, in this respect, that it satisfies the wishes of men in a
way corresponding to the nature of wishes&mdash;in the most desirable
way. Wishes own no restraint, no law, no time; they would be fulfilled
without delay on the instant. And behold! miracle is as rapid as a wish
is impatient. Miraculous power realises human wishes in a moment, at
one stroke, without any hindrance. That the sick should become well is
no miracle; but that they should become so immediately, at a mere word
of command,&mdash;that is the mystery of miracle. Thus it is not in its
product or object that miraculous agency is distinguished from the
agency of Nature and reason, but only in its mode and process; for if
miraculous power were to effect something absolutely new, never before
beheld, never conceived, or not even conceivable, it would be
practically proved to be an essentially different, and at the same time
objective, agency. But the agency which in essence, in substance, is
natural and accordant with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130"
href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>forms of the senses, and
which is supernatural, supersensual, only in the mode or process, is
the agency of the imagination. The power of miracle is therefore
nothing else than the power of the imagination.</p>
<p>Miraculous agency is agency directed to an end. The yearning after
the departed Lazarus, the desire of his relatives to possess him again,
was the motive of the miraculous resuscitation; the satisfaction of
this wish, the end. It is true that the miracle happened &ldquo;for the
glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby;&rdquo;
but the message sent to the Master by the sisters of Lazarus,
&ldquo;Behold, he whom thou lovest is sick,&rdquo; and the tears which
Jesus shed, vindicate for the miracle a human origin and end. The
meaning is: to that power which can awaken the dead no human wish is
impossible to accomplish.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3154src" href=
"#xd21e3154" name="xd21e3154src">5</a> And the glory of the Son
consists in this: that he is acknowledged and reverenced as the being
who is able to do what man is unable but wishes to do. Activity towards
an end is well known to describe a circle: in the end it returns upon
its beginning. But miraculous agency is distinguished from the ordinary
realisation of an object in that it realises the end without means,
that it effects an immediate identity of the wish and its fulfilment;
that consequently it describes a circle, not in a curved, but in a
straight line, that is, the shortest line. A circle in a straight line
is the mathematical symbol of miracle. The attempt to construct a
circle with a straight line would not be more ridiculous than the
attempt to deduce miracle philosophically. To reason, miracle is
absurd, inconceivable; as inconceivable as wooden iron or a circle
without a periphery. Before it is discussed whether a miracle can
happen, let it be shown that miracle, i.e., the inconceivable, is
conceivable.</p>
<p>What suggests to man the notion that miracle is conceivable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>is that miracle is represented as an event
perceptible by the senses, and hence man cheats his reason by material
images which screen the contradiction. The miracle of the turning of
water into wine, for example, implies in fact nothing else than that
water is wine,&mdash;nothing else than that two absolutely
contradictory predicates or subjects are identical; for in the hand of
the miracle-worker there is no distinction between the two substances;
the transformation is only the visible appearance of this identity of
two contradictories. But the transformation conceals the contradiction,
because the natural conception of change is interposed. Here, however,
is no gradual, no natural, or, so to speak, organic change; but an
absolute, immaterial one; a pure <i lang="la">creatio ex nihilo</i>. In
the mysterious and momentous act of miraculous power, in the act which
constitutes the miracle, water is suddenly and imperceptibly wine:
which is equivalent to saying that iron is wood, or wooden iron.</p>
<p>The miraculous act&mdash;and miracle is only a transient
act&mdash;is therefore not an object of thought, for it nullifies the
very principle of thought; but it is just as little an object of sense,
an object of real or even possible experience. Water is indeed an
object of sense, and wine also; I first see water and then wine; but
the miracle itself, that which makes this water suddenly
wine,&mdash;this, not being a natural process, but a pure perfect
without any antecedent imperfect, without any <i>modus</i>, without way
or means, is no object of real, or even of possible experience. Miracle
is a thing of the imagination; and on that very account is it so
agreeable: for the imagination is the faculty which alone corresponds
to personal feeling, because it sets aside all limits, all laws which
are painful to the feelings, and thus makes objective to man the
immediate, absolutely unlimited satisfaction of his subjective
wishes.<a id="xd21e3175" name="xd21e3175"></a><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3176src" href="#xd21e3176" name="xd21e3176src">6</a> Accordance
with subjective inclination is the essential characteristic of miracle.
It is true that miracle produces also an awful, agitating impression,
so far as it expresses a power which nothing can resist,&mdash;the
power of the imagination. But this impression lies only in the
transient miraculous act; the abiding, essential <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>impression is the agreeable one. At the moment
in which the beloved Lazarus is raised up, the surrounding relatives
and friends are awestruck at the extraordinary, almighty power which
transforms the dead into the living; but soon the relatives fall into
the arms of the risen one, and lead him with tears of joy to his home,
there to celebrate a festival of rejoicing. Miracle springs out of
feeling, and has its end in feeling. Even in the traditional
representation it does not deny its origin; the representation which
gratifies the feelings is alone the adequate one. Who can fail to
recognise in the narrative of the resurrection of Lazarus the tender,
pleasing, legendary tone?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3184src" href=
"#xd21e3184" name="xd21e3184src">7</a> Miracle is agreeable, because,
as has been said, it satisfies the wishes of man without labour,
without effort. Labour is unimpassioned, unbelieving, rationalistic;
for man here makes his existence dependent on activity directed to an
end, which activity again is itself determined solely by the idea of
the objective world. But feeling does not at all trouble itself about
the objective world; it does not go out of or beyond itself; it is
happy in itself. The element of culture, the Northern principle of
self-renunciation, is wanting to the emotional nature. The Apostles and
Evangelists were no scientifically cultivated men. Culture, in general,
is nothing else than the exaltation of the individual above his
subjectivity to objective universal ideas, to the contemplation of the
world. The Apostles were men of the people; the people live only in
themselves, in their feelings; therefore Christianity took possession
of the people. <i>Vox populi vox Dei.</i> Did Christianity conquer a
single philosopher, historian, or poet of the classical period? The
philosophers who went over to Christianity were feeble, contemptible
philosophers. All who had yet the classic spirit in them were hostile,
or at least indifferent to Christianity. The decline of culture was
identical with the victory of Christianity. The classic spirit, the
spirit of culture, limits itself by laws,&mdash;not indeed by
arbitrary, finite laws, but by inherently true and valid ones; it is
determined by the necessity, the truth of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>nature of things; in a word, it is the objective
spirit. In place of this, there entered with Christianity the principle
of unlimited, extravagant, fanatical, supranaturalistic subjectivity; a
principle intrinsically opposed to that of science, of
culture.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3193src" href="#xd21e3193" name=
"xd21e3193src">8</a> With Christianity man lost the capability of
conceiving himself as a part of Nature, of the universe. As long as
true, unfeigned, unfalsified, uncompromising Christianity existed, as
long as Christianity was a living, practical truth, so long did real
miracles happen; and they necessarily happened, for faith in dead,
historical, past miracles is itself a dead faith, the first step
towards unbelief, or rather the first and therefore the timid,
uncandid, servile mode in which unbelief in miracle finds vent. But
where miracles happen, all definite forms melt in the golden haze of
imagination and feeling; there the world, reality, is no truth; there
the miracle-working, emotional, <i>i.e.</i>, subjective being, is held
to be alone the objective, real being.</p>
<p>To the merely emotional man the imagination is immediately, without
his willing or knowing it, the highest, the dominant activity; and
being the highest, it is the activity of God, the creative activity. To
him feeling is an immediate truth and reality; he cannot abstract
himself from his feelings, he cannot get beyond them: and equally real
is his imagination. The imagination is not to him what it is to us men
of active understanding, who distinguish it as subjective from
objective cognition; it is immediately identical with himself, with his
feelings; and since it is identical with his being, it is his
essential, objective, necessary view of things. For us, indeed,
imagination is an arbitrary activity; but where man has not imbibed the
principle of culture, of theory, where he lives and moves only in his
feelings, the imagination is an immediate, involuntary activity.</p>
<p>The explanation of miracles by feeling and imagination is regarded
by many in the present day as superficial. But let any one transport
himself to the time when living, present miracles were believed in;
when the reality of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"
name="pb134">134</a>]</span>things without us was as yet no sacred
article of faith; when men were so void of any theoretic interest in
the world, that they from day to day looked forward to its destruction;
when they lived only in the rapturous prospect and hope of heaven, that
is, in the imagination of it (for whatever heaven may be, for them, so
long as they were on earth, it existed only in the imagination); when
this imagination was not a fiction but a truth, nay, the eternal, alone
abiding truth, not an inert, idle source of consolation, but a
practical moral principle determining actions, a principle to which men
joyfully sacrificed real life, the real world with all its
glories;&mdash;let him transport himself to those times and he must
himself be very superficial to pronounce the psychological genesis of
miracles superficial. It is no valid objection that miracles have
happened, or are supposed to have happened, in the presence of whole
assemblies: no man was independent, all were filled with exalted
supranaturalistic ideas and feelings; all were animated by the same
faith, the same hope, the same hallucinations. And who does not know
that there are common or similar dreams, common or similar visions,
especially among impassioned individuals who are closely united and
restricted to their own circle? But be that as it may. If the
explanation of miracles by feeling and imagination is superficial, the
charge of superficiality falls not on the explainer, but on that which
he explains, namely, on miracle; for, seen in clear daylight, miracle
presents absolutely nothing else than the sorcery of the imagination,
which satisfies without contradiction all the wishes of the
heart.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3206src" href="#xd21e3206" name=

&ldquo;God is Almighty; but he who believes is a God.&rdquo; Luther (in
Chr. Kapps <i lang="de">Christus u. die Weltgeschichte</i>, s. 11). In
another place Luther calls faith the &ldquo;Creator of the
Godhead;&rdquo; it is true that he immediately adds, as he must
necessarily do on his standpoint, the following
limitation:&mdash;&ldquo;Not that it creates anything in the Divine
Eternal Being, but that it creates that Being in us&rdquo; (Th. xi. p.
161).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e3112src">&uarr;</a></p>

belief is so essential to the Bible, that without it the biblical
writers can scarcely be understood. The passage <a class=
"biblink xd21e48" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pt%203:8">2 Pet. iii.
8</a>, as is evident from the tenor of the whole chapter, says nothing
in opposition to an immediate destruction of the world; for though with
the Lord a thousand years are as one day, yet at the same time one day
is as a thousand years, and therefore the world may, even by to-morrow,
no longer exist. That in the Bible a very near end of the world is
expected and prophesied, although the day and hour are not determined,
only falsehood or blindness can deny. (See on this subject
<i>L&uuml;tzelberger</i>.) Hence religious Christians, in almost all
times, have believed that the destruction of the world is near at
hand&mdash;Luther, for example, often says that &ldquo;The last day is
not far off&rdquo; (<i>e.g.</i>, Th. xvi. p. 26);&mdash;or at least
their souls have longed for the end of the world, though they have
prudently left it undecided whether it be near or distant. See Augustin
(de Fine S&aelig;culi ad Hesychium, c. 13).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

and will raise from death. He does it not at all times and to every
one.... It is enough that he has done it a few times; the rest he
leaves to the last day.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. p. 518). The
positive, essential significance of miracle is therefore that the
divine nature is the human nature. Miracles confirm, authenticate
doctrine. What doctrine? Simply this, that God is a Saviour of men,
their Redeemer out of all trouble, <i>i.e.</i>, a being corresponding
to the wants and wishes of man, and therefore a human being. What the
God-man declares in words, miracle demonstrates <i>ad oculos</i> by

<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY OF THE RESURRECTION AND OF THE MIRACULOUS
CONCEPTION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The quality of being agreeable to subjective
inclination belongs not only to practical miracles, in which it is
conspicuous, as they have immediate reference to the interest or wish
of the human individual; it belongs also to theoretical, or more
properly dogmatic miracles, and hence to the Resurrection and the
Miraculous Conception.</p>
<p>Man, at least in a state of ordinary well-being, has the wish not to
die. This wish is originally identical with the instinct of
self-preservation. Whatever lives seeks to maintain itself, to continue
alive, and consequently not to die. Subsequently, when reflection and
feeling are developed under the urgency of life, especially of social
and political life, this primary negative wish becomes the positive
wish for a life, and that a better life, after death. But this wish
involves the further wish for the certainty of its fulfilment. Reason
can afford no such certainty. It has therefore been said that all
proofs of immortality are insufficient, and even that unassisted reason
is not capable of apprehending it, still less of proving it. And with
justice; for reason furnishes only general proofs; it cannot give the
certainty of any personal immortality, and it is precisely this
certainty which is desired. Such a certainty requires an immediate
personal assurance, a practical demonstration. This can only be given
to me by the fact of a dead person, whose death has been previously
certified, rising again from the grave; and he must be no indifferent
person, but, on the contrary, the type and representative of all
others, so that his resurrection also may be the type, the guarantee of
theirs. The resurrection of Christ is therefore the satisfied desire of
man for an immediate certainty of his personal existence after
death,&mdash;personal immortality as a sensible, indubitable fact.</p>
<p>Immortality was with the heathen philosophers a question in which
the personal interest was only a collateral point. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>They
concerned themselves chiefly with the nature of the soul, of mind, of
the vital principle. The immortality of the vital principle by no means
involves the idea, not to mention the certainty, of personal
immortality. Hence the vagueness, discrepancy, and dubiousness with
which the ancients express themselves on this subject. The Christians,
on the contrary, in the undoubting certainty that their personal,
self-flattering wishes will be fulfilled, <i>i.e.</i>, in the certainty
of the divine nature of their emotions, the truth and unassailableness
of their subjective feelings, converted that which to the ancients was
a theoretic problem into an immediate fact,&mdash;converted a
theoretic, and in itself open question, into a matter of conscience,
the denial of which was equivalent to the high treason of atheism. He
who denies the resurrection denies the resurrection of Christ, but he
who denies the resurrection of Christ denies Christ himself, and he who
denies Christ denies God. Thus did &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; Christianity
unspiritualise what was spiritual! To the Christians the immortality of
the reason, of the soul, was far too abstract and negative; they had at
heart only a personal immortality, such as would gratify their
feelings, and the guarantee of this lies in a bodily resurrection
alone. The resurrection of the body is the highest triumph of
Christianity over the sublime but certainly abstract spirituality and
objectivity of the ancients. For this reason the idea of the
resurrection could never be assimilated by the pagan mind.</p>
<p>As the Resurrection, which terminates the sacred history (to the
Christian not a mere history, but the truth itself), is a realised
wish, so also is that which commences it, namely, the Miraculous
Conception, though this has relation not so much to an immediately
personal interest as to a particular subjective feeling.</p>
<p>The more man alienates himself from Nature, the more subjective,
<i>i.e.</i>, supranatural or antinatural, is his view of things, the
greater the horror he has of Nature, or at least of those natural
objects and processes which displease his imagination, which affect him
disagreeably.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3234src" href="#xd21e3234"
name="xd21e3234src">1</a> The free, objective <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>man
doubtless finds things repugnant and distasteful in Nature, but he
regards them as natural, inevitable results, and under this conviction
he subdues his feeling as a merely subjective and untrue one. On the
contrary, the subjective man, who lives only in the feelings and
imagination, regards these things with a quite peculiar aversion. He
has the eye of that unhappy foundling, who even in looking at the
loveliest flower could pay attention only to the little &ldquo;black
beetle&rdquo; which crawled over it, and who by this perversity of
perception had his enjoyment in the sight of flowers always embittered.
Moreover, the subjective man makes his feelings the measure, the
standard of what ought to be. That which does not please him, which
offends his transcendental, supranatural, or antinatural feelings,
ought not to be. Even if that which pleases him cannot exist without
being associated with that which displeases him, the subjective man is
not guided by the wearisome laws of logic and physics, but by the
self-will of the imagination; hence he drops what is disagreeable in a
fact, and holds fast alone what is agreeable. Thus the idea of the
pure, holy Virgin pleases him; still he is also pleased with the idea
of the Mother, but only of the Mother who already carries the infant on
her arms.</p>
<p>Virginity in itself is to him the highest moral idea, the <i lang=
"la">cornu copi&aelig;</i> of his supranaturalistic feelings and ideas,
his personified sense of honour and of shame before common
nature.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3246src" href="#xd21e3246" name=
"xd21e3246src">2</a> Nevertheless, there stirs in his bosom a natural
feeling also, the compassionate feeling which makes the Mother beloved.
What then is to be done in this difficulty of the heart, in this
conflict between a natural and a supranatural <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>feeling? The supranaturalist must unite the two,
must comprise in one and the same subject two predicates which exclude
each other.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3261src" href="#xd21e3261" name=
"xd21e3261src">3</a> Oh, what a plenitude of agreeable, sweet,
supersensual, sensual emotions lies in this combination!</p>
<p>Here we have the key to the contradiction in Catholicism, that at
the same time marriage is holy and celibacy is holy. This simply
realises, as a practical contradiction, the dogmatic contradiction of
the Virgin Mother. But this wondrous union of virginity and maternity,
contradicting Nature and reason, but in the highest degree accordant
with the feelings and imagination, is no product of Catholicism; it
lies already in the twofold part which marriage plays in the Bible,
especially in the view of the Apostle Paul. The supernatural conception
of Christ is a fundamental doctrine of Christianity, a doctrine which
expresses its inmost dogmatic essence, and which rests on the same
foundation as all other miracles and articles of faith. As death, which
the philosopher, the man of science, the free objective thinker in
general, accepts as a natural necessity, and as indeed all the limits
of nature, which are impediments to feeling, but to reason are rational
laws, were repugnant to the Christians, and were set aside by them
through the supposed agency of miraculous power; so, necessarily, they
had an equal repugnance to the natural process of generation, and
superseded it by miracle. The Miraculous Conception is not less welcome
than the Resurrection to all believers; for it was the first step
towards the purification of mankind, polluted by sin and Nature. Only
because the God-man was not infected with original sin, could he, the
pure one, purify mankind in the eyes of God, to whom the natural
process of generation was an object of aversion, because he himself is
nothing else but supranatural feeling.</p>
<p>Even the arid Protestant orthodoxy, so arbitrary in its criticism,
regarded the conception of the God-producing Virgin as a great,
adorable, amazing, holy mystery of faith, transcending reason.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3279src" href="#xd21e3279" name="xd21e3279src">4</a>
But with the Protestants, who confined <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>the speciality of the
Christian to the domain of faith, and with whom, in life, it was
allowable to be a man, even this mystery had only a dogmatic, and no
longer a practical significance; they did not allow it to interfere
with their desire of marriage. With the Catholics, and with all the
old, uncompromising, uncritical Christians, that which was a mystery of
faith was a mystery of life, of morality.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3287src" href="#xd21e3287" name="xd21e3287src">5</a> Catholic
morality is Christian, mystical; Protestant morality was, in its very
beginning, rationalistic. Protestant morality is and was a carnal
mingling of the Christian with the man, the natural, political, civil,
social man, or whatever else he may be called in distinction from the
Christian; Catholic morality cherished in its heart the mystery of the
unspotted virginity. Catholic morality was the <i lang="la">Mater
dolorosa</i>; Protestant morality a comely, fruitful matron.
Protestantism is from beginning to end the contradiction between faith
and love; for which very reason it has been the source, or at least the
condition, of freedom. Just because the mystery of the <i lang=
"la">Virgo Deipara</i> had with the Protestants a place only in theory,
or rather in dogma, and no longer in practice, they declared that it
was impossible to express oneself with sufficient care and reserve
concerning it, and that it ought not to be made an object of
speculation. That which is denied in practice has no true basis and
durability in man, is a mere spectre of the mind; and hence it is
withdrawn from the investigation of the understanding. Ghosts do not
brook daylight.</p>
<p>Even the later doctrine (which, however, had been already enunciated
in a letter to St. Bernard, who rejects it), that Mary herself was
conceived without taint of original sin, is by no means a
&ldquo;strange school-bred doctrine,&rdquo; as it is called by a modern
historian. That which gives birth to a miracle, which brings forth God,
must itself be of miraculous divine origin or nature. How could Mary
have had the honour of being overshadowed by the Holy Ghost if she had
not been from the first pure? Could the Holy Ghost take up his abode in
a body polluted by original sin? If the principle of Christianity, the
miraculous birth of the Saviour, does not appear strange to you, why
think strange the na&iuml;ve, well-meaning inferences of Catholicism?

<h2 class="main">THE MYSTERY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHRIST, OR THE PERSONAL
GOD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The fundamental dogmas of Christianity are realised
wishes of the heart;&mdash;the essence of Christianity is the essence
of human feeling. It is pleasanter to be passive than to act, to be
redeemed and made free by another than to free oneself; pleasanter to
make one&rsquo;s salvation dependent on a person than on the force of
one&rsquo;s own spontaneity; pleasanter to set before oneself an object
of love than an object of effort; pleasanter to know oneself beloved by
God than merely to have that simple, natural self-love which is innate
in all beings; pleasanter to see oneself imaged in the love-beaming
eyes of another personal being, than to look into the concave mirror of
self or into the cold depths of the ocean of Nature; pleasanter, in
short, to allow oneself to be acted on by one&rsquo;s own feeling, as
by another, but yet fundamentally identical being, than to regulate
oneself by reason. Feeling is the oblique case of the <i>ego</i>, the
<i>ego</i> in the accusative. The <i>ego</i> of Fichte is destitute of
feeling, because the accusative is the same as the nominative, because
it is indeclinable. But feeling or sentiment is the <i>ego</i> acted on
by itself, and by itself as another being,&mdash;the passive
<i>ego</i>. Feeling changes the active in man into the passive, and the
passive into the active. To feeling, that which thinks is the thing
thought, and the thing thought is that which thinks. Feeling is the
dream of Nature; and there is nothing more blissful, nothing more
profound than dreaming. But what is dreaming? The reversing of the
waking consciousness. In dreaming, the active is the passive, the
passive the active; in dreaming, I take the spontaneous action of my
own mind for an action upon me from without, my emotions for events, my
conceptions and sensations for true existences apart from myself. I
suffer what I also perform. Dreaming is a double refraction of the rays
of light; hence its indescribable charm. It is the same <i>ego</i>, the
same being in dreaming as in waking; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>the only distinction
is, that in waking, the <i>ego</i> acts on itself; whereas in dreaming
it is acted on by itself as by another being. <i>I think
myself</i>&mdash;is a passionless, rationalistic position; <i>I am
thought by God</i>, and think myself only as thought by God&mdash;is a
position pregnant with feeling, religious. Feeling is a dream with the
eyes open; religion the dream of waking consciousness: dreaming is the
key to the mysteries of religion.</p>
<p>The highest law of feeling is the immediate unity of will and deed,
of wishing and reality. This law is fulfilled by the Redeemer. As
external miracles, in opposition to natural activity, realise
immediately the physical wants and wishes of man; so the Redeemer, the
Mediator, the God-man, in opposition to the moral spontaneity of the
natural or rationalistic man, satisfies immediately the inward moral
wants and wishes, since he dispenses man on his own side from any
intermediate activity. What thou wishest is already effected. Thou
desirest to win, to deserve happiness. Morality is the condition, the
means of happiness. But thou canst not fulfil this condition; that is,
in truth, thou needest not. That which thou seekest to do has already
been done. Thou hast only to be passive, thou needest only believe,
only enjoy. Thou desirest to make God favourable to thee, to appease
his anger, to be at peace with thy conscience. But this peace exists
already; this peace is the Mediator, the God-man. He is thy appeased
conscience; he is the fulfilment of the law, and therewith the
fulfilment of thy own wish and effort.</p>
<p>Therefore it is no longer the law, but the fulfiller of the law, who
is the model, the guiding thread, the rule of thy life. He who fulfils
the law annuls the law. The law has authority, has validity, only in
relation to him who violates it. But he who perfectly fulfils the law
says to it: What thou willest I spontaneously will, and what thou
commandest I enforce by deeds; my life is the true, the living law. The
fulfiller of the law, therefore, necessarily steps into the place of
the law; moreover he becomes a new law, one whose yoke is light and
easy. For in place of the merely imperative law, he presents himself as
an example, as an object of love, of admiration and emulation, and thus
becomes the Saviour from sin. The law does not give me the power to
fulfil the law; no! it is hard and merciless; it only <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>commands, without troubling itself whether I can
fulfil it, or how I am to fulfil it; it leaves me to myself, without
counsel or aid. But he who presents himself to me as an example lights
up my path, takes me by the hand, and imparts to me his own strength.
The law lends no power of resisting sin, but example works miracles.
The law is dead; but example animates, inspires, carries men
involuntarily along with it. The law speaks only to the understanding,
and sets itself directly in opposition to the instincts; example, on
the contrary, appeals to a powerful instinct immediately connected with
the activity of the senses, that of involuntary imitation. Example
operates on the feelings and imagination. In short, example has
magical, <i>i.e.</i>, sense-affecting powers; for the magical or
involuntary force of attraction is an essential property, as of matter
in general, so in particular of that which affects the senses.</p>
<p>The ancients said that if virtue could become visible, its beauty
would win and inspire all hearts. The Christians were so happy as to
see even this wish fulfilled. The heathens had an unwritten, the Jews a
written law; the Christians had a model&mdash;a visible, personal,
living law, a law made flesh. Hence the joyfulness especially of the
primitive Christians, hence the glory of Christianity that it alone
contains and bestows the power to resist sin. And this glory is not to
be denied it. Only, it is to be observed that the power of the exemplar
of virtue is not so much the power of virtue as the power of example in
general; just as the power of religious music is not the power of
religion, but the power of music;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3351src"
href="#xd21e3351" name="xd21e3351src">1</a> and that therefore, though
the image of virtue has virtuous actions as its consequences, these
actions are destitute of the dispositions and motives of virtue. But
this simple and true sense of the redeeming and reconciling power of
example in distinction from the power of law, to which we have reduced
the antithesis of the law and Christ, by no means expresses the full
religious significance of the Christian redemption and reconciliation.
In this everything reduces itself to the personal power of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>that
miraculous intermediate being who is neither God alone nor man alone,
but a man who is also God, and a God who is also man, and who can
therefore only be comprehended in connection with the significance of
miracle. In this, the miraculous Redeemer is nothing else than the
realised wish of feeling to be free from the laws of morality,
<i>i.e.</i>, from the conditions to which virtue is united in the
natural course of things; the realised wish to be freed from moral
evils instantaneously, immediately, by a stroke of magic, that is, in
an absolutely subjective, agreeable way. &ldquo;The word of God,&rdquo;
says Luther, for example, &ldquo;accomplishes all things swiftly,
brings forgiveness of sins, and gives thee eternal life, and costs
nothing more than that thou shouldst hear the word, and when thou hast
heard it shouldst believe. If thou believest, thou hast it without
pains, cost, delay, or difficulty.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3362src" href="#xd21e3362" name="xd21e3362src">2</a> But that
hearing of the word of God which is followed by faith is itself a
&ldquo;gift of God.&rdquo; Thus faith is nothing else than a
psychological miracle, a supernatural operation of God in man, as
Luther likewise says. But man becomes free from sin and from the
consciousness of guilt only through faith,&mdash;morality is dependent
on faith, the virtues of the heathens are only splendid sins; thus he
becomes morally free and good only through miracle.</p>
<p>That the idea of miraculous power is one with the idea of the
intermediate being, at once divine and human, has historical proof in
the fact that the miracles of the Old Testament, the delivery of the
law, providence&mdash;all the elements which constitute the essence of
religion, were in the later Judaism attributed to the Logos. In Philo,
however, this Logos still hovers in the air between heaven and earth,
now as abstract, now as concrete; that is, Philo vacillates between
himself as a philosopher and himself as a religious
Israelite&mdash;between the positive element of religion and the
metaphysical idea of deity; but in such a way that even the abstract
element is with him more or less invested with imaginative forms. In
Christianity this Logos first attained perfect consistence,
<i>i.e.</i>, religion now concentrated itself exclusively on that
element, that object, which is the basis of its essential difference.
The Logos is the personified essence of religion. Hence the definition
of God as the essence of feeling has its complete truth only in the
Logos. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>God as God is feeling as yet shut up, hidden; only Christ is the
unclosed, open feeling or heart. In Christ feeling is first perfectly
certain of itself, and assured beyond doubt of the truth and divinity
of its own nature; for Christ denies nothing to feeling; he fulfils all
its prayers. In God the soul is still silent as to what affects it most
closely,&mdash;it only sighs; but in Christ it speaks out fully; here
it has no longer any reserves. To him who only sighs, wishes are still
attended with disquietude; he rather complains that what he wishes is
not, than openly, positively declares what he wishes; he is still in
doubt whether his wishes have the force of law. But in Christ all
anxiety of the soul vanishes; he is the sighing soul passed into a song
of triumph over its complete satisfaction; he is the joyful certainty
of feeling that its wishes hidden in God have truth and reality, the
actual victory over death, over all the powers of the world and Nature,
the resurrection no longer merely hoped for, but already accomplished;
he is the heart released from all oppressive limits, from all
sufferings,&mdash;the soul in perfect blessedness, the Godhead made
visible.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3373src" href="#xd21e3373" name=
"xd21e3373src">3</a></p>
<p>To see God is the highest wish, the highest triumph of the heart.
Christ is this wish, this triumph, fulfilled. God, as an object of
thought only, <i>i.e.</i>, God as God, is always a remote being; the
relation to him is an abstract one, like that relation of friendship in
which we stand to a man who is distant from us, and personally unknown
to us. However his works, the proofs of love which he gives us, may
make his nature present to us, there always remains an unfilled
void,&mdash;the heart is unsatisfied, we long to see him. So long as we
have not met a being face to face, we are always in doubt whether he be
really such as we imagine him; actual presence alone gives final
confidence, perfect repose. Christ <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145"
href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>is God known personally;
Christ, therefore, is the blessed certainty that God is what the soul
desires and needs him to be. God, as the object of prayer, is indeed
already a human being, since he sympathises with human misery, grants
human wishes; but still he is not yet an object to the religious
consciousness as a real man. Hence, only in Christ is the last wish of
religion realised, the mystery of religious feeling
solved:&mdash;solved however in the language of imagery proper to
religion, for what God is in essence, that Christ is in actual
appearance. So far the Christian religion may justly be called the
absolute religion. That God, who in himself is nothing else than the
nature of man, should also have a real existence as such, should be as
man an object to the consciousness&mdash;this is the goal of religion;
and this the Christian religion has attained in the incarnation of God,
which is by no means a transitory act, for Christ remains man even
after his ascension,&mdash;man in heart and man in form, only that his
body is no longer an earthly one, liable to suffering.</p>
<p>The incarnations of the Deity with the Orientals&mdash;the Hindoos,
for example&mdash;have no such intense meaning as the Christian
incarnation; just because they happen often they become indifferent,
they lose their value. The manhood of God is his personality; the
proposition, God is a personal being, means: God is a human being, God
is a man. Personality is an abstraction, which has reality only in an
actual man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3385src" href="#xd21e3385" name=
"xd21e3385src">4</a> The idea which lies at the foundation of the
incarnations of God is therefore infinitely better conveyed by one
incarnation, one personality. Where God appears in several persons
successively, these personalities are evanescent. What is required is a
permanent, an exclusive personality. Where there are many incarnations,
room is given for innumerable others; the imagination is not
restrained; and even those incarnations which are already real pass
into the category of the merely possible and conceivable, into the
category of fancies or of mere appearances. But where one personality
is exclusively believed in and contemplated, this at once <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>impresses with the power of an historical
personality; imagination is done away with, the freedom to imagine
others is renounced. This one personality presses on me the belief in
its reality. The characteristic of real personality is precisely
exclusiveness,&mdash;the Leibnitzian principle of distinction, namely,
that no one existence is exactly like another. The tone, the emphasis,
with which the one personality is expressed, produces such an effect on
the feelings, that it presents itself immediately as a real one, and is
converted from an object of the imagination into an object of
historical knowledge.</p>
<p>Longing is the <i>necessity</i> of feeling, and feeling longs for a
personal God. But this longing after the personality of God is true,
earnest, and profound only when it is the longing for one personality,
when it is satisfied with one. With the plurality of persons the truth
of the want vanishes, and personality becomes a mere luxury of the
imagination. But that which operates with the force of necessity,
operates with the force of reality on man. That which to the feelings
is a necessary being, is to them immediately a real being. Longing
says: There must be a personal God, i.e., it cannot be that there is
not; satisfied feeling says: He is. The guarantee of his existence lies
for feeling in its sense of the necessity of his existence the
necessity of the satisfaction in the force of the want. Necessity knows
no law besides itself; necessity breaks iron. Feeling knows no other
necessity than its own, than the necessity of feeling, than longing; it
holds in extreme horror the necessity of Nature, the necessity of
reason. Thus to feeling, a subjective, sympathetic, personal God is
necessary; but it demands one personality alone, and this an
historical, real one. Only when it is satisfied in the unity of
personality has feeling any concentration; plurality dissipates it.</p>
<p>But as the truth of personality is unity, and as the truth of unity
is reality, so the truth of real personality is&mdash;<i>blood</i>. The
last proof, announced with peculiar emphasis by the author of the
fourth Gospel, that the visible person of God was no phantasm, no
illusion, but a real man, is that blood flowed from his side on the
cross. If the personal God has a true sympathy with distress, he must
himself suffer distress. Only in his suffering lies the assurance of
his reality; only on this depends the impressiveness of the
incarnation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>To see God does not satisfy feeling; the eyes
give no sufficient guarantee. The truth of vision is confirmed only by
touch. But as subjectively touch, so objectively the capability of
being touched, palpability, passibility, is the last criterion of
reality; hence the passion of Christ is the highest confidence, the
highest self-enjoyment, the highest consolation of feeling; for only in
the blood of Christ is the thirst for a personal, that is, a human,
sympathising, tender God allayed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Wherefore we hold it to be a
pernicious error when such (namely, divine) majesty is taken away from
Christ according to his manhood, thereby depriving Christians of their
highest consolation, which they have in ... the promise of the presence
of their Head, King and High Priest, who has promised them that not his
mere Godhead, which to us poor sinners is as a consuming fire to dry
stubble, but he&mdash;he the Man&mdash;who has spoken with us, who has
proved all sorrows in the human form which he took upon him, who
therefore can have fellow-feeling with us as his brethren,&mdash;that
he will be with us in all our need, according to the nature whereby he
is our brother and we are flesh of his flesh.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3405src" href="#xd21e3405" name="xd21e3405src">5</a></p>
<p>It is superficial to say that Christianity is not the religion of
one personal God, but of three personalities. These three personalities
have certainly an existence in dogma; but even there the personality of
the Holy Spirit is only an arbitrary decision which is contradicted by
impersonal definitions; as, for example, that the Holy Spirit is the
gift of the Father and Son.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3410src" href=
"#xd21e3410" name="xd21e3410src">6</a> Already the very
&ldquo;procession&rdquo; of the Holy Ghost presents an evil prognostic
for his personality, for a personal being is produced only by
generation, not by an indefinite emanation or by <i lang=
"la">spiratio</i>. And even the Father, as the representative of the
rigorous idea of the Godhead, is a personal being only according to
opinion and assertion, not according to his definitions; he is an
abstract idea, a purely rationalistic being. Only Christ is the plastic
personality. To personality belongs form; form is the reality
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>of personality. Christ alone is the personal
God; he is the real God of Christians, a truth which cannot be too
often repeated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3418src" href="#xd21e3418"
name="xd21e3418src">7</a> In him alone is concentrated the Christian
religion, the essence of religion in general. He alone meets the
longing for a personal God; he alone is an existence identical with the
nature of feeling; on him alone are heaped all the joys of the
imagination, and all the sufferings of the heart; in him alone are
feeling and imagination exhausted. Christ is the blending in one of
feeling and imagination.</p>
<p>Christianity is distinguished from other religions by this, that in
other religions the heart and imagination are divided, in Christianity
they coincide. Here the imagination does not wander, left to itself; it
follows the leadings of the heart; it describes a circle, whose centre
is feeling. Imagination is here limited by the wants of the heart, it
only realises the wishes of feeling, it has reference only to the one
thing needful; in brief, it has, at least generally, a practical,
concentric tendency, not a vagrant, merely poetic one. The miracles of
Christianity&mdash;no product of free, spontaneous activity, but
conceived in the bosom of yearning, necessitous feeling&mdash;place us
immediately on the ground of common, real life; they act on the
emotional man with irresistible force, because they have the necessity
of feeling on their side. The power of imagination is here at the same
time the power of the heart,&mdash;imagination is only the victorious,
triumphant heart. With the Orientals, with the Greeks, imagination,
untroubled by the wants of the heart, revelled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>in
the enjoyment of earthly splendour and glory; in Christianity, it
descended from the palace of the gods into the abode of poverty, where
only want rules,&mdash;it humbled itself under the sway of the heart.
But the more it limited itself in extent, the more intense became its
strength. The wantonness of the Olympian gods could not maintain itself
before the rigorous necessity of the heart; but imagination is
omnipotent when it has a bond of union with the heart. And this bond
between the freedom of the imagination and the necessity of the heart
is Christ. All things are subject to Christ; he is the Lord of the
world, who does with it what he will; but this unlimited power over
Nature is itself again subject to the power of the heart;&mdash;Christ
commands raging Nature to be still, but only that he may hear the sighs
of the needy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=

orthodox theologians against the heterodox; for example, against the
Socinians. Modern theologians, indeed, agree with the latter, as is
well known, in pronouncing the divinity of Christ as accepted by the
Church to be unbiblical; but it is undeniably the characteristic
principle of Christianity, and even if it does not stand in the Bible
in the form which is given to it by dogma, it is nevertheless a
necessary consequence of what is found in the Bible. A being who is the
fulness of the Godhead bodily, who is omniscient (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2016:30">John xvi.

all things, both in time and rank, who has life in himself (though an
imparted life) like as the Father has life in himself,&mdash;what, if
we follow out the consequences, can such a being be, but God?
&ldquo;Christ is one with the Father in will;&rdquo;&mdash;but unity of
will presupposes unity of nature. &ldquo;Christ is the ambassador, the
representative of God;&rdquo;&mdash;but God can only be represented by
a divine being. I can only choose as my representative one in whom I

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND
HEATHENISM.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Christ is the omnipotence of subjectivity, the heart
released from all the bonds and laws of Nature, the soul excluding the
world, and concentrated only on itself, the reality of all the
heart&rsquo;s wishes, the Easter festival of the heart, the ascent to
heaven of the imagination:&mdash;Christ therefore is the distinction of
Christianity from heathenism.</p>
<p>In Christianity, man was concentrated only on himself, he unlinked
himself from the chain of sequences in the system of the universe, he
made himself a self-sufficing whole, an absolute, extra- and
supra-mundane being. Because he no longer regarded himself as a being
immanent in the world, because he severed himself from connection with
it, he felt himself an unlimited being&mdash;(for the sole limit of
subjectivity is the world, is objectivity),&mdash;he had no longer any
reason to doubt the truth and validity of his subjective wishes and
feelings.</p>
<p>The heathens, on the contrary, not shutting out Nature by retreating
within themselves, limited their subjectivity by the contemplation of
the world. Highly as the ancients estimated the intelligence, the
reason, they were yet liberal and objective enough, theoretically as
well as practically, to allow that which they distinguished from mind,
namely, matter, to live, and even to live eternally; the Christians
evinced their theoretical as well as practical intolerance in their
belief that they secured the eternity of their subjective life only by
annihilating, as in the doctrine of the destruction of the world, the
opposite of subjectivity&mdash;Nature. The ancients were free from
themselves, but their freedom was that of indifference towards
themselves; the Christians were free from Nature, but their freedom was
not that of reason, not true freedom, which limits itself by the
contemplation of the world, by Nature,&mdash;it was the freedom of
feeling and imagination, the freedom of miracle. The ancients were so
enraptured by the cosmos, that they lost sight of themselves,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>suffered themselves to be merged in the whole;
the Christians despised the world;&mdash;what is the creature compared
with the Creator? what are sun, moon, and earth compared with the human
soul?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3443src" href="#xd21e3443" name=
"xd21e3443src">1</a> The world passes away, but man, nay, the
individual, personal man, is eternal. If the Christians severed man
from all community with Nature, and hence fell into the extreme of an
arrogant fastidiousness, which stigmatised the remotest comparison of
man with the brutes as an impious violation of human dignity; the
heathens, on the other hand, fell into the opposite extreme, into that
spirit of depreciation which abolishes the distinction between man and
the brute, or even, as was the case, for example, with Celsus, the
opponent of Christianity, degrades man beneath the brute.</p>
<p>But the heathens considered man not only in connection with the
universe; they considered the individual man, in connection with other
men, as member of a commonwealth. They rigorously distinguished the
individual from the species, the individual as a part from the race as
a whole, and they subordinated the part to the whole. Men pass away,
but mankind remains, says a heathen philosopher. &ldquo;Why wilt thou
grieve over the loss of thy daughter?&rdquo; writes Sulpicius to
Cicero. &ldquo;Great, renowned cities and empires have passed away, and
thou behavest thus at the death of an <i>homunculus</i>, a little human
being! Where is thy philosophy?&rdquo; The idea of man as an individual
was to the ancients a secondary one, attained through the idea of the
species. Though they thought highly of the race, highly of the
excellences of mankind, highly and sublimely of the intelligence, they
nevertheless thought slightly of the individual. Christianity, on the
contrary, cared nothing for the species, and had only the individual in
its eye and mind. Christianity&mdash;not, certainly, the Christianity
of the present day, which has incorporated with itself the culture of
heathenism, and has preserved only the name and some general positions
of Christianity&mdash;is the direct opposite of heathenism, and only
when it is regarded as such is it truly comprehended, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>and
untravestied by arbitrary speculative interpretation; it is true so far
as its opposite is false, and false so far as its opposite is true. The
ancients sacrificed the individual to the species; the Christians
sacrificed the species to the individual. Or, heathenism conceived the
individual only as a part in distinction from the whole of the species;
Christianity, on the contrary, conceived the individual only in
immediate, undistinguishable unity with the species.</p>
<p>To Christianity the individual was the object of an immediate
providence, that is, an immediate object of the Divine Being. The
heathens believed in a providence for the individual only through his
relation to the race, through law, through the order of the world, and
thus only in a mediate, natural, and not miraculous
providence;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3455src" href="#xd21e3455" name=
"xd21e3455src">2</a> but the Christians left out the intermediate
process, and placed themselves in immediate connection with the
prescient, all-embracing, universal Being; <i>i.e.</i>, they
immediately identified the individual with the universal Being.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>But the idea of deity coincides with the idea of humanity. All
divine attributes, all the attributes which make God God, are
attributes of the species&mdash;attributes which in the individual are
limited, but the limits of which are abolished in the essence of the
species, and even in its existence, in so far as it has its complete
existence only in all men taken together. My knowledge, my will, is
limited; but my limit is not the limit of another man, to say nothing
of mankind; what is difficult to me is easy to another; what is
impossible, inconceivable, to one age, is to the coming age conceivable
and possible. My life is bound to a limited time; not so the life of
humanity. The history of mankind consists of nothing else than a
continuous and progressive conquest of limits, which at a given time
pass for the limits of humanity, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>therefore for
absolute insurmountable limits. But the future always unveils the fact
that the alleged limits of the species were only limits of individuals.
The most striking proofs of this are presented by the history of
philosophy and of physical science. It would be highly interesting and
instructive to write a history of the sciences entirely from this point
of view, in order to exhibit in all its vanity the presumptuous notion
of the individual <span class="corr" id="xd21e3470" title=
"Source: than">that</span> he can set limits to his race. Thus the
species is unlimited; the individual alone limited.</p>
<p>But the sense of limitation is painful, and hence the individual
frees himself from it by the contemplation of the perfect Being; in
this contemplation he possesses what otherwise is wanting to him. With
the Christians God is nothing else than the immediate unity of species
and individuality, of the universal and individual being. God is the
idea of the species as an individual&mdash;the idea or essence of the
species, which as a species, as universal being, as the totality of all
perfections, of all attributes or realities, freed from all the limits
which exist in the consciousness and feeling of the individual, is at
the same time again an individual, personal being. <i>Ipse suum esse
est.</i> Essence and existence are in God identical; which means
nothing else than that he is the idea, the essence of the species,
conceived immediately as an existence, an individual. The highest idea
on the standpoint of religion is: God does not love, he is himself
love; he does not live, he is life; he is not just, but justice itself;
not a person, but personality itself,&mdash;the species, the idea, as
immediately a concrete existence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3478src"
href="#xd21e3478" name="xd21e3478src">3</a></p>
<p>Because of this immediate unity of the species with individuality,
this concentration of all that is universal and real in one personal
being, God is a deeply moving object, enrapturing to the imagination;
whereas, the idea of humanity has little power over the feelings,
because humanity is only an abstraction; and the reality which presents
itself to us in distinction from this abstraction is the multitude of
separate, limited individuals. In God, on the contrary, feeling has
immediate satisfaction, because here all is embraced in one,
<i>i.e.</i>, because here the species has an immediate
existence,&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154"
name="pb154">154</a>]</span>is an individuality. God is love, is
justice, as itself a subject; he is the perfect universal being as one
being, the infinite extension of the species as an all-comprehending
unity. But God is only man&rsquo;s intuition of his own nature; thus
the Christians are distinguished from the heathens in this, that they
immediately identify the individual with the species&mdash;that with
them the individual has the significance of the species, the individual
by himself is held to be the perfect representative of the
species&mdash;that they deify the human individual, make him the
absolute being.</p>
<p>Especially characteristic is the difference between Christianity and
heathenism concerning the relation of the individual to the
intelligence, to the understanding, to the <span class="trans" title=
"nous"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&nu;&omicron;&#8166;&sigmaf;</span></span>. The Christians
individualised the understanding, the heathens made it a universal
essence. To the heathens, the understanding, the intelligence, was the
essence of man; to the Christians, it was only a part of themselves. To
the heathens therefore only the intelligence, the species, to the
Christians, the individual, was immortal, <i>i.e.</i>, divine. Hence
follows the further difference between heathen and Christian
philosophy.</p>
<p>The most unequivocal expression, the characteristic symbol of this
immediate identity of the species and individuality in Christianity is
Christ, the real God of the Christians. Christ is the ideal of humanity
become existent, the compendium of all moral and divine perfections to
the exclusion of all that is negative; pure, heavenly, sinless man, the
typical man, the Adam Kadmon; not regarded as the totality of the
species, of mankind, but immediately as one individual, one person.
Christ, <i>i.e.</i>, the Christian, religious Christ, is therefore not
the central, but the terminal point of history. The Christians expected
the end of the world, the close of history. In the Bible, Christ
himself, in spite of all the falsities and sophisms of our exegetists,
clearly prophesies the speedy end of the world. History rests only on
the distinction of the individual from the race. Where this distinction
ceases, history ceases; the very soul of history is extinct. Nothing
remains to man but the contemplation and appropriation of this realised
Ideal, and the spirit of proselytism, which seeks to extend the
prevalence of a fixed belief,&mdash;the preaching that God has
appeared, and that the end of the world is at hand. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>Since the immediate identity of the species and the individual
oversteps the limits of reason and Nature, it followed of course that
this universal, ideal individual was declared to be a transcendent,
supernatural, heavenly being. It is therefore a perversity to attempt
to deduce from reason the immediate identity of the species and
individual, for it is only the imagination which effects this identity,
the imagination to which nothing is impossible, and which is also the
creator of miracles; for the greatest of miracles is the being who,
while he is an individual, is at the same time the ideal, the species,
humanity in the fulness of its perfection and infinity, <i>i.e.</i>,
the Godhead. Hence it is also a perversity to adhere to the biblical or
dogmatic Christ, and yet to thrust aside miracles. If the principle be
retained, wherefore deny its necessary consequences?</p>
<p>The total absence of the idea of the species in Christianity is
especially observable in its characteristic doctrine of the universal
sinfulness of men. For there lies at the foundation of this doctrine
the demand that the individual shall not be an individual, a demand
which again is based on the presupposition that the individual by
himself is a perfect being, is by himself the adequate presentation or
existence of the species.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3515src" href=
"#xd21e3515" name="xd21e3515src">4</a> Here is entirely wanting the
objective perception, the consciousness, that the <i>thou</i> belongs
to the perfection of the <i>I</i>, that <i>men</i> are required to
constitute humanity, that only men taken together are what man should
and can be. All men are sinners. Granted; but they are not all sinners
in the same way; on the contrary, there exists a great and essential
difference between them. One man is inclined to falsehood, another is
not; he would rather give up his life than break his word or tell a
lie; the third has a propensity to intoxication, the fourth to
licentiousness; while the fifth, whether by favour of Nature, or from
the energy of his character, exhibits none of these vices. Thus, in the
moral as well as the physical and intellectual elements, men compensate
for each other, so that, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>taken as a whole, they are, as
they should be, they present the perfect man.</p>
<p>Hence intercourse ameliorates and elevates; involuntarily and
without disguise, man is different in intercourse from what he is when
alone. Love especially works wonders, and the love of the sexes most of
all. Man and woman are the complement of each other, and thus united
they first present the species, the perfect man.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3531src" href="#xd21e3531" name="xd21e3531src">5</a> Without
species, love is inconceivable. Love is nothing else than the
self-consciousness of the species as evolved within the difference of
sex. In love, the reality of the species, which otherwise is only a
thing of reason, an object of mere thought, becomes a matter of
feeling, a truth of feeling; for in love, man declares himself
unsatisfied in his individuality taken by itself, he postulates the
existence of another as a need of the heart; he reckons another as part
of his own being; he declares the life which he has through love to be
the truly human life, corresponding to the idea of man, <i>i.e.</i>, of
the species. The individual is defective, imperfect, weak, needy; but
love is strong, perfect, contented, free from wants, self-sufficing,
infinite; because in it the self-consciousness of the individuality is
the mysterious self-consciousness of the perfection of the race. But
this result of love is produced by friendship also, at least where it
is intense, where it is a religion,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3537src"
href="#xd21e3537" name="xd21e3537src">6</a> as it was with the
ancients. Friends compensate for each other; friendship is a means of
virtue, and more: it is itself virtue, dependent however on
participation. Friendship can only exist between the virtuous, as the
ancients said. But it cannot be based on perfect similarity; on the
contrary, it requires diversity, for friendship rests on a desire for
self-completion. One friend obtains through the other what he does not
himself possess. The virtues of the one atone for the failings of the
other. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>Friend justifies friend before God. However
faulty a man may be, it is a proof that there is a germ of good in him
if he has worthy men for his friends. If I cannot be myself perfect, I
yet at least love virtue, perfection in others. If therefore I am
called to account for any sins, weaknesses, and faults, I interpose as
advocates, as mediators, the virtues of my friend. How barbarous, how
unreasonable would it be to condemn me for sins which I doubtless have
committed, but which I have myself condemned in loving my friends, who
are free from these sins!</p>
<p>But if friendship and love, which themselves are only subjective
realisations of the species, make out of singly imperfect beings an at
least relatively perfect whole, how much more do the sins and failings
of individuals vanish in the species itself, which has its adequate
existence only in the sum total of mankind, and is therefore only an
object of reason! Hence the lamentation over sin is found only where
the human individual regards himself in his individuality as a perfect,
complete being, not needing others for the realisation of the species,
of the perfect man; where instead of the consciousness of the species
has been substituted the exclusive self-consciousness of the
individual; where the individual does not recognise himself as a part
of mankind, but identifies himself with the species, and for this
reason makes his own sins, limits and weaknesses, the sins, limits, and
weaknesses of mankind in general. Nevertheless man cannot lose the
consciousness of the species, for his self-consciousness is essentially
united to his consciousness of another than himself. Where therefore
the species is not an object to him as a species, it will be an object
to him as God. He supplies the absence of the idea of the species by
the idea of God, as the being who is free from the limits and wants
which oppress the individual, and, in his opinion (since he identifies
the species with the individual), the species itself. But this perfect
being, free from the limits of the individual, is nothing else than the
species, which reveals the infinitude of its nature in this, that it is
realised in infinitely numerous and various individuals. If all men
were absolutely alike, there would then certainly be no distinction
between the race and the individual. But in that case the existence of
many men would be a pure superfluity; a single man would have achieved
the ends of the species. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>In the one who enjoyed the
happiness of existence all would have had their complete
substitute.</p>
<p>Doubtless the essence of man is <i>one</i>, but this essence is
infinite; its real existence is therefore an infinite, reciprocally
compensating variety, which reveals the riches of this essence. Unity
in essence is multiplicity in existence. Between me and another human
being&mdash;and this other is the representative of the species, even
though he is only one, for he supplies to me the want of many others,
has for me a universal significance, is the deputy of mankind, in whose
name he speaks to me, an isolated individual, so that, when united only
with one, I have a participated, a human life;&mdash;between me and
another human being there is an essential, qualitative distinction. The
other is my <i>thou</i>,&mdash;the relation being reciprocal,&mdash;my
<i>alter ego</i>, man objective to me, the revelation of my own nature,
the eye seeing itself. In another I first have the consciousness of
humanity; through him I first learn, I first feel, that I am a man: in
my love for him it is first clear to me that he belongs to me and I to
him, that we two cannot be without each other, that only community
constitutes humanity. But morally, also, there is a qualitative,
critical distinction between the <i>I</i> and <i>thou</i>. My
fellow-man is my objective conscience; he makes my failings a reproach
to me; even when he does not expressly mention them, he is my
personified feeling of shame. The consciousness of the moral law, of
right, of propriety, of truth itself, is indissolubly united with my
consciousness of another than myself. That is true in which another
agrees with me,&mdash;agreement is the first criterion of truth; but
only because the species is the ultimate measure of truth. That which I
think only according to the standard of my individuality is not binding
on another; it can be conceived otherwise; it is an accidental, merely
subjective view. But that which I think according to the standard of
the species, I think as man in general only can think, and consequently
as every individual must think if he thinks normally, in accordance
with law, and therefore truly. That is true which agrees with the
nature of the species, that is false which contradicts it. There is no
other rule of truth. But my fellow-man is to me the representative of
the species, the substitute of the rest, nay, his judgment may be of
more authority with me than the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159"
href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>judgment of the innumerable
multitude. Let the fanatic make disciples as the sand on the sea-shore;
the sand is still sand; mine be the pearl&mdash;a judicious friend. The
agreement of others is therefore my criterion of the normalness, the
universality, the truth of my thoughts. I cannot so abstract myself
from myself as to judge myself with perfect freedom and
disinterestedness; but another has an impartial judgment; through him I
correct, complete, extend my own judgment, my own taste, my own
knowledge. In short, there is a qualitative, critical difference
between men. But Christianity extinguishes this qualitative
distinction; it sets the same stamp on all men alike, and regards them
as one and the same individual, because it knows no distinction between
the species and the individual: it has one and the same means of
salvation for all men, it sees one and the same original sin in
all.</p>
<p>Because Christianity thus, from exaggerated subjectivity, knows
nothing of the species, in which alone lies the redemption, the
justification, the reconciliation and cure of the sins and deficiencies
of the individual, it needed a supernatural and peculiar, nay, a
personal, subjective aid in order to overcome sin. If I alone am the
species, if no other, that is, no qualitatively different men exist,
or, which is the same thing, if there is no distinction between me and
others, if we are all perfectly alike, if my sins are not neutralised
by the opposite qualities of other men: then assuredly my sin is a blot
of shame which cries up to heaven; a revolting horror which can be
exterminated only by extraordinary, superhuman, miraculous means.
Happily, however, there <i>is</i> a natural reconciliation. My
fellow-man is <i>per se</i> the mediator between me and the sacred idea
of the species. <i>Homo homini Deus est.</i> My sin is made to shrink
within its limits, is thrust back into its nothingness, by the fact
that it is only mine, and not that of my fellows. <span class=

that the divine providence extended not merely to the general, but also
to the particular, the individual; but they identified providence with
Nature, law, necessity. The Stoics, who were the orthodox speculatists
of heathenism, did indeed believe in miracles wrought by providence
(Cic. de Nat. Deor. l. ii. and De Divinat. l. i.); but their miracles

<h2 class="main">THE CHRISTIAN SIGNIFICANCE OF VOLUNTARY CELIBACY AND
MONACHISM.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The idea of man as a species, and with it the
significance of the life of the species, of humanity as a whole,
vanished as Christianity became dominant. Herein we have a new
confirmation of the position advanced, that Christianity does not
contain within itself the principle of culture. Where man immediately
identifies the species with the individual, and posits this identity as
his highest being, as God, where the idea of humanity is thus an object
to him only as the idea of Godhead, there the need of culture has
vanished; man has all in himself, all in his God, consequently he has
no need to supply his own deficiencies by others as the representatives
of the species, or by the contemplation of the world generally; and
this need is alone the spring of culture. The individual man attains
his end by himself alone; he attains it in God,&mdash;God is himself
the attained goal, the realised highest aim of humanity; but God is
present to each individual separately. God only is the want of the
Christian; others, the human race, the world, are not necessary to him;
he is not the inward need of others. God fills to me the place of the
species, of my fellow-men; yes, when I turn away from the world, when I
am in isolation, I first truly feel my need of God, I first have a
lively sense of his presence, I first feel what God is, and what he
ought to be to me. It is true that the religious man has need also of
fellowship, of edification in common; but this need of others is always
in itself something extremely subordinate. The salvation of the soul is
the fundamental idea, the main point in Christianity; and this
salvation lies only in God, only in the concentration of the mind on
him. Activity for others is required, is a condition of salvation; but
the ground of salvation is God, immediate reference in all things to
God. And even activity for others <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>has only a religious
significance, has reference only to God, as its motive and end, is
essentially only an activity for God,&mdash;for the glorifying of his
name, the spreading abroad of his praise. But God is absolute
subjectivity,&mdash;subjectivity separated from the world, above the
world, set free from matter, severed from the life of the species, and
therefore from the distinction of sex. Separation from the world, from
matter, from the life of the species, is therefore the essential aim of
Christianity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3588src" href="#xd21e3588"
name="xd21e3588src">1</a> And this aim had its visible, practical
realisation in Monachism.</p>
<p>It is a self-delusion to attempt to derive monachism from the East.
At least, if this derivation is to be accepted, they who maintain it
should be consistent enough to derive the opposite tendency of
Christendom, not from Christianity, but from the spirit of the Western
nations, the occidental nature in general. But how, in that case, shall
we explain the monastic enthusiasm of the West? Monachism must rather
be derived directly from Christianity itself: it was necessary
consequence of the belief in heaven promised to mankind by
Christianity. Where the heavenly life is a truth, the earthly life is a
lie; where imagination is all, reality is nothing. To him who believes
in an eternal heavenly life, the present life loses its value,&mdash;or
rather, it has already lost its value: belief in the heavenly life is
belief in the worthlessness and nothingness of this life. I cannot
represent to myself the future life without longing for it, without
casting down a look of compassion or contempt on this pitiable earthly
life, and the heavenly life can be no object, no law of faith, without,
at the same time, being a law of morality: it must determine my
actions,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3593src" href="#xd21e3593" name=
"xd21e3593src">2</a> at least if my life is to be in accordance with my
faith: I ought not to cleave to the transitory things of this earth. I
<i>ought</i> not;&mdash;but neither do I <i>wish</i>; for what are all
things here below compared with the glory of the heavenly
life?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3602src" href="#xd21e3602" name=
"xd21e3602src">3</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"
name="pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is true that the quality of that life depends on the quality, the
moral condition of this; but morality is itself determined by the faith
in eternal life. The morality corresponding to the super-terrestrial
life is simply separation from the world, the negation of this life;
and the practical attestation of this spiritual separation is the
monastic life.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3622src" href="#xd21e3622"
name="xd21e3622src">4</a> Everything must ultimately take an external
form, must present itself to the senses. An inward disposition must
become an outward practice. The life of the cloister, indeed ascetic
life in general, is the heavenly life as it is realised and can be
realised here below. If my soul belongs to heaven, ought I, nay, can I
belong to the earth with my body? The soul animates the body. But if
the soul is in heaven, the body is forsaken, dead, and thus the medium,
the organ of connection between the world and the soul is annihilated.
Death, the separation of the soul from the body, at least from this
gross, material, sinful body, is the entrance into heaven. But if death
is the condition of blessedness and moral perfection, then necessarily
mortification is the one law of morality. Moral death is the necessary
anticipation of natural death; I say necessary, for it would be the
extreme of immorality to attribute the obtaining of heaven to physical
death, which is no moral act, but a natural one common to man and the
brute. Death must therefore be exalted into a moral, a spontaneous act.
&ldquo;I die daily,&rdquo; says the apostle, and this dictum Saint
Anthony, the founder of monachism,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3628src"
href="#xd21e3628" name="xd21e3628src">5</a> made the theme of his
life.</p>
<p>But Christianity, it is contended, demanded only a spiritual
freedom. True; but what is that spiritual freedom which does not pass
into action, which does not attest itself in practice? Or dost thou
believe that it only depends on thyself, on thy will, on thy intention,
whether thou be free from anything? If so, thou art greatly in error,
and hast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>never experienced what it is to be truly made
free. So long as thou art in a given rank, profession, or relation, so
long art thou, willingly or not, determined by it. Thy will, thy
determination, frees thee only from conscious limitations and
impressions, not from the unconscious ones which lie in the nature of
the case. Thus we do not feel at home, we are under constraint, so long
as we are not locally, physically separated from one with whom we have
inwardly broken. External freedom is alone the full truth of spiritual
freedom. A man who has really lost spiritual interest in earthly
treasures soon throws them out at window, that his heart may be
thoroughly at liberty. What I no longer possess by inclination is a
burden to me; so away with it! What affection has let go, the hand no
longer holds fast. Only affection gives force to the grasp; only
affection makes possession sacred. He who having a wife is as though he
had her not, will do better to have no wife at all. To have as though
one had not, is to have without the disposition to have, is in truth
not to have. And therefore he who says that one ought to have a thing
as though one had it not, merely says in a subtle, covert, cautious
way, that one ought not to have it at all. That which I dismiss from my
heart is no longer mine,&mdash;it is free as air. St. Anthony took the
resolution to renounce the world when he had once heard the saying,
&ldquo;If thou wilt be perfect, go thy way, sell that thou hast and
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and
follow me.&rdquo; St. Anthony gave the only true interpretation of this
text. He went his way, and sold his possessions, and gave the proceeds
to the poor. Only thus did he prove his spiritual freedom from the
treasures of this world.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3638src" href=
"#xd21e3638" name="xd21e3638src">6</a></p>
<p>Such freedom, such truth, is certainly in contradiction with the
Christianity of the present day, according to which the Lord has
required only a spiritual freedom, <i>i.e.</i>, a freedom which demands
no sacrifice, no energy,&mdash;an illusory, self-deceptive
freedom;&mdash;a freedom from earthly good, which consists in its
possession and enjoyment! For certainly the Lord said, &ldquo;My yoke
is easy.&rdquo; How harsh, how <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"
href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>unreasonable would
Christianity be if it exacted from man the renunciation of earthly
riches! Then assuredly Christianity would not be suited to this world.
So far from this, Christianity is in the highest degree practical and
judicious; it defers the freeing oneself from the wealth and pleasures
of this world to the moment of natural death (monkish mortification is
an unchristian suicide);&mdash;and allots to our spontaneous activity
the acquisition and enjoyment of earthly possessions. Genuine
Christians do not indeed doubt the truth of the heavenly
life,&mdash;God forbid! Therein they still agree with the ancient
monks; but they await that life patiently, submissive to the will of
God, <i>i.e.</i>, to their own selfishness, to the agreeable pursuit of
worldly enjoyment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3657src" href=
"#xd21e3657" name="xd21e3657src">7</a> But I turn away with loathing
and contempt from modern Christianity, in which the bride of Christ
readily acquiesces in polygamy, at least in successive polygamy, and
this in the eyes of the true Christian does not essentially differ from
contemporaneous polygamy; but yet at the same time&mdash;oh! shameful
hypocrisy!&mdash;swears by the eternal, universally binding,
irrefragable sacred truth of God&rsquo;s Word. I turn back with
reverence to the misconceived truth of the chaste monastic cell, where
the soul betrothed to heaven did not allow itself to be wooed into
faithlessness by a strange earthly body!</p>
<p>The unworldly, supernatural life is essentially also an unmarried
life. The celibate lies already, though not in the form of a law, in
the inmost nature of Christianity. This is sufficiently declared in the
supernatural origin of the Saviour,&mdash;a doctrine in which unspotted
virginity is hallowed as the saving principle, as the principle of the
new, the Christian world. Let not such passages as, &ldquo;Be fruitful
and multiply,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;What God has joined together let not
man put asunder,&rdquo; be urged as a sanction of marriage. The first
passage relates, as Tertullian and Jerome have already observed, only
to the unpeopled earth, not to the earth when filled with men, only to
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>beginning, not to the end of the world, an end
which was initiated by the immediate appearance of God upon earth. And
the second also refers only to marriage as an institution of the Old
Testament. Certain Jews proposed the question whether it were lawful
for a man to separate from his wife; and the most appropriate way of
dealing with this question was the answer above cited. He who has once
concluded a marriage ought to hold it sacred. Marriage is intrinsically
an indulgence to the weakness or rather the strength of the flesh, an
evil which therefore must be restricted as much as possible. The
indissolubleness of marriage is a <i>nimbus</i>, a sacred irradiance,
which expresses precisely the opposite of what minds, dazzled and
perturbed by its lustre, seek beneath it. Marriage in itself is, in the
sense of perfected Christianity, a sin,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3673src" href="#xd21e3673" name="xd21e3673src">8</a> or rather a
weakness which is permitted and forgiven thee only on condition that
thou for ever limitest thyself to a single wife. In short, marriage is
hallowed only in the Old Testament, but not in the New. The New
Testament knows a higher, a supernatural principle, the mystery of
unspotted virginity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3678src" href=
"#xd21e3678" name="xd21e3678src">9</a> &ldquo;He who can receive it let
him receive it.&rdquo; &ldquo;The children of this world marry, and are
given in marriage: but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain
that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are
given in marriage: neither can they die any more: for they are equal
unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the
resurrection.&rdquo; Thus in heaven there is no marriage; the principle
of sexual love is excluded from heaven as an earthly, worldly
principle. But the heavenly life is the true, perfected, eternal life
of the Christian. Why then should I, who am destined for heaven, form a
tie which is unloosed in my true destination? Why should I, who am
potentially a heavenly being, not realise this possibility even
here?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3681src" href="#xd21e3681" name=

"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>my
mind, my heart, since it is expelled from heaven, the essential object
of my faith, hope, and life. How can an earthly wife have a place in my
heaven-filled heart? How can I divide my heart between God and
man?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3687src" href="#xd21e3687" name=
"xd21e3687src">11</a> The Christian&rsquo;s love to God is not an
abstract or general love such as the love of truth, of justice, of
science; it is a love to a subjective, personal God, and is therefore a
subjective, personal love. It is an essential attribute of this love
that it is an exclusive, jealous love, for its object is a personal and
at the same time the highest being, to whom no other can be compared.
&ldquo;Keep close to Jesus [Jesus Christ is the Christian&rsquo;s God],
in life and in death; trust his faithfulness: he alone can help thee,
when all else leaves thee. Thy beloved has this quality, that he will
suffer no rival; he alone will have thy heart, will rule alone in thy
soul as a king on his throne.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What can the world
profit thee without Jesus? To be without Christ is the pain of hell; to
be with Christ, heavenly sweetness.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thou canst not
live without a friend: but if the friendship of Christ is not more than
all else to thee, thou wilt be beyond measure sad and
disconsolate.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Love everything for Jesus&rsquo;
sake, but Jesus for his own sake. Jesus Christ alone is worthy to be
loved.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My God, my love [my heart]: thou art wholly
mine, and I am wholly thine.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Love hopes and trusts
ever in God, even when God is not gracious to it [or tastes bitter,
<i>non sapit</i>]; for we cannot live in love without sorrow.... For
the sake of the beloved, the loving one must accept all things, even
the hard and bitter.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My God and my all, ... in thy
presence everything is sweet to me, in thy absence everything is
distasteful.... Without thee nothing can please
me.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, when at last will that blessed, longed-for
hour appear, when thou wilt satisfy me wholly, and be all in all to me?
So long as this is not granted me, my joy is only
fragmentary.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;When was it well with me without thee?
or when was it ill with me in thy presence? I will rather be poor for
thy sake, than rich without thee. I will rather be a pilgrim on earth
with thee, than the possessor of heaven without thee. Where thou art is
heaven; death and hell where thou art <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>not. I long only for
thee.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thou canst not serve God and at the same time
have thy joys in earthly things: thou must wean thyself from all
acquaintances and friends, and sever thy soul from all temporal
consolation. Believers in Christ should regard themselves, according to
the admonition of the Apostle Peter, only as strangers and pilgrims on
the earth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3695src" href="#xd21e3695"
name="xd21e3695src">12</a> Thus love to God as a personal being is a
literal, strict, personal, exclusive love. How then can I at once love
God and a mortal wife? Do I not thereby place God on the same footing
with my wife? No! to a soul which truly loves God, the love of woman is
an impossibility, is adultery. &ldquo;He that is unmarried,&rdquo; says
the Apostle Paul, &ldquo;careth for the things that belong to the Lord,
how he may please the Lord; but he that is married careth for the
things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The true Christian not only feels no need of culture, because this
is a worldly principle and opposed to feeling; he has also no need of
(natural) love. God supplies to him the want of culture, and in like
manner God supplies to him the want of love, of a wife, of a family.
The Christian immediately identifies the species with the individual;
hence he strips off the difference of sex as a burdensome, accidental
adjunct.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3700src" href="#xd21e3700" name=
"xd21e3700src">13</a> Man and woman together first constitute the true
man; man and woman together are the existence of the race, for their
union is the source of multiplicity, the source of other men. Hence the
man who does not deny his manhood, is conscious that he is only a part
of a being, which needs another part for the making up of the whole of
true humanity. The Christian, on the contrary, in his excessive,
transcendental subjectivity, conceives that he is, by himself, a
perfect being. But the sexual instinct runs counter to this view; it is
in contradiction with his ideal: the Christian must therefore deny this
instinct.</p>
<p>The Christian certainly experienced the need of sexual love, but
only as a need in contradiction with his heavenly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>destination, and merely natural, in the
depreciatory, contemptuous sense which this word had in
Christianity,&mdash;not as a moral, inward need&mdash;not, if I may so
express myself, as a metaphysical, <i>i.e.</i>, an essential need,
which man can experience only where he does not separate difference of
sex from himself, but, on the contrary, regards it as belonging to his
inmost nature. Hence marriage is not holy in Christianity; at least it
is so only apparently, illusively; for the natural principle of
marriage, which is the love of the sexes,&mdash;however civil marriage
may in endless instances contradict this,&mdash;is in Christianity an
unholy thing, and excluded from heaven.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3710src" href="#xd21e3710" name="xd21e3710src">14</a> But that
which man excludes from heaven he excludes from his true nature. Heaven
is his treasure-casket. Believe not in what he establishes on earth,
what he permits and sanctions here: here he must accommodate himself;
here many things come athwart him which do not fit into his system;
here he shuns thy glance, for he finds himself among strangers who
intimidate him. But watch for him when he throws off his incognito, and
shows himself in his true dignity, his heavenly state. In heaven he
speaks as he thinks; there thou hearest his true opinion. Where his
heaven is, there is his heart,&mdash;heaven is his heart laid open.
Heaven is nothing but the idea of the true, the good, the
valid,&mdash;of that which ought to be; earth, nothing but the idea of
the untrue, the unlawful, of that which ought not to be. The Christian
excludes from heaven the life of the species: there the species ceases,
there dwell only pure sexless individuals, &ldquo;spirits;&rdquo; there
absolute subjectivity reigns:&mdash;thus the Christian excludes the
life of the species <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169"
name="pb169">169</a>]</span>from his conception of the true life; he
pronounces the principle of marriage sinful, negative; for the sinless,

no religious significance, no religious principle and exemplar. It is
otherwise with the Greeks, where, for example, &ldquo;Zeus and Here are
the great archetype of every marriage&rdquo; (Creuzer, Symbol.); with
the ancient Parsees, where procreation, as &ldquo;the multiplication of
the human race, is the diminution of the empire of Ahriman,&rdquo; and
thus a religious art and duty (Zend-Avesta); with the Hindoos, where
the son is the regenerated father. Among the Hindoos no regenerate man
could assume the rank of a Sanyassi, that is, of an anchorite absorbed
in God, if he had not previously paid three debts, one of which was
that he had had a legitimate son. Amongst the Christians, on the
contrary, at least the Catholics, it was a true festival of religious
rejoicing when betrothed or even married persons&mdash;supposing that
it happened with mutual consent&mdash;renounced the married state and
sacrificed conjugal to religious love.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Inasmuch as the religious consciousness restores everything which it
begins by abolishing, and the future life is ultimately nothing else
than the present life re-established, it follows that sex must be
re-established. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Erunt ... similes angelorum.
Ergo homines non desinent ... ut apostolus apostolus sit et Maria
Maria.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;<span lang="la">Hieronymus (ad Theodorum
Viduam)</span>. But as the body in the other world is an incorporeal
body, so necessarily the sex there is one without difference,
<i>i.e.</i>, a sexless sex.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main">THE CHRISTIAN HEAVEN, OR PERSONAL IMMORTALITY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The unwedded and ascetic life is the direct way to the
heavenly, immortal life, for heaven is nothing else than life liberated
from the conditions of the species, supernatural, sexless, absolutely
subjective life. The belief in personal immortality has at its
foundation the belief that difference of sex is only an external
adjunct of individuality, that in himself the individual is a sexless,
independently complete, absolute being. But he who belongs to no sex
belongs to no species; sex is the cord which connects the individuality
with the species, and he who belongs to no species, belongs only to
himself, is an altogether independent, divine, absolute being. Hence
only when the species vanishes from the consciousness is the heavenly
life a certainty. He who lives in the consciousness of the species, and
consequently of its reality, lives also in the consciousness of the
reality of sex. He does not regard it as a mechanically inserted,
adventitious stone of stumbling, but as an inherent quality, a chemical
constituent of his being. He indeed recognises himself as a man in the
broader sense, but he is at the same time conscious of being rigorously
determined by the sexual distinction, which penetrates not only bones
and marrow, but also his inmost self, the essential mode of his
thought, will, and sensation. He therefore who lives in the
consciousness of the species, who limits and determines his feelings
and imagination by the contemplation of real life, of real man, can
conceive no life in which the life of the species, and therewith the
distinction of sex, is abolished; he regards the sexless individual,
the heavenly spirit, as an agreeable figment of the imagination.</p>
<p>But just as little as the real man can abstract himself from the
distinction of sex, so little can he abstract himself from his moral or
spiritual constitution, which indeed is profoundly connected with his
natural constitution. Precisely because he lives in the contemplation
of the whole, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>he also lives in the consciousness that he is
himself no more than a part, and that he is what he is only by virtue
of the conditions which constitute him a member of the whole, or a
relative whole. Every one, therefore, justifiably regards his
occupation, his profession, his art or science, as the highest; for the
mind of man is nothing but the essential mode of his activity. He who
is skilful in his profession, in his art, he who fills his post well,
and is entirely devoted to his calling, thinks that calling the highest
and best. How can he deny in thought what he emphatically declares in
act by the joyful devotion of all his powers? If I despise a thing, how
can I dedicate to it my time and faculties? If I am compelled to do so
in spite of my aversion, my activity is an unhappy one, for I am at war
with myself. Work is worship. But how can I worship or serve an object,
how can I subject myself to it, if it does not hold a high place in my
mind? In brief, the occupations of men determine their judgment, their
mode of thought, their sentiments. And the higher the occupation, the
more completely does a man identify himself with it. In general,
whatever a man makes the essential aim of his life, he proclaims to be
his soul; for it is the principle of motion in him. But through his
aim, through the activity in which he realises this aim, man is not
only something for himself, but also something for others, for the
general life, the species. He therefore who lives in the consciousness
of the species as a reality, regards his existence for others, his
relation to society, his utility to the public, as that existence which
is one with the existence of his own essence&mdash;as his immortal
existence. He lives with his whole soul, with his whole heart, for
humanity. How can he hold in reserve a special existence for himself,
how can he separate himself from mankind? How shall he deny in death
what he has enforced in life? And in life his faith is this: <i>Nec
sibi sed toti genitum se credere mundo</i>.</p>
<p>The heavenly life, or what we do not here distinguish from
it&mdash;personal immortality, is a characteristic doctrine of
Christianity. It is certainly in part to be found among the heathen
philosophers; but with them it had only the significance of a
subjective conception, because it was not connected with their
fundamental view of things. How contradictory, for example, are the
expressions of the Stoics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=
"#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>on this subject! It was among the
Christians that personal immortality first found that principle, whence
it follows as a necessary and obvious consequence. The contemplation of
the world, of Nature, of the race, was always coming athwart the
ancients; they distinguished between the principle of life and the
living subject, between the soul, the mind, and self: whereas the
Christian abolished the distinction between soul and person, species
and individual, and therefore placed immediately in self what belongs
only to the totality of the species. But the immediate unity of the
species and individuality is the highest principle, the God of
Christianity,&mdash;in it the individual has the significance of the
absolute being,&mdash;and the necessary, immanent consequence of this
principle is personal immortality.</p>
<p>Or rather: the belief in personal immortality is perfectly identical
with the belief in a personal God;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, that which
expresses the belief in the heavenly, immortal life of the person,
expresses God also, as he is an object to Christians, namely, as
absolute, unlimited personality. Unlimited personality is God; but
heavenly personality, or the perpetuation of human personality in
heaven, is nothing else than personality released from all earthly
encumbrances and limitations; the only distinction is, that God is
heaven spiritualised, while heaven is God materialised, or reduced to
the forms of the senses: that what in God is posited only <i lang=
"la">in abstracto</i> is in heaven more an object of the imagination.
God is the implicit heaven; heaven is the explicit God. In the present,
God is the kingdom of heaven; in the future, heaven is God. God is the
pledge, the as yet abstract presence and existence of heaven; the
anticipation, the epitome of heaven. Our own future existence, which,
while we are in this world, in this body, is a separate, objective
existence,&mdash;is God: God is the idea of the species, which will be
first realised, individualised in the other world. God is the heavenly,
pure, free essence, which exists there as heavenly pure beings, the
bliss which there unfolds itself in a plenitude of blissful
individuals. Thus God is nothing else than the idea or the essence of
the absolute, blessed, heavenly life, here comprised in an ideal
personality. This is clearly enough expressed in the belief that the
blessed life is unity with God. Here we are distinguished and separated
from God, there the partition falls; here we are men, there gods;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>here the Godhead is a monopoly, there it is a
common possession; here it is an abstract unity, there a concrete
multiplicity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3758src" href="#xd21e3758"
name="xd21e3758src">1</a></p>
<p>The only difficulty in the recognition of this is created by the
imagination, which, on the one hand by the conception of the
personality of God, on the other by the conception of the many
personalities which it places in a realm ordinarily depicted in the
hues of the senses, hides the real unity of the idea. But in truth
there is no distinction between the absolute life which is conceived as
God and the absolute life which is conceived as heaven, save that in
heaven we have stretched into length and breadth what in God is
concentrated in one point. The belief in the immortality of man is the
belief in the divinity of man, and the belief in God is the belief in
pure personality, released from all limits, and consequently <i>eo
ipso</i> immortal. The distinctions made between the immortal soul and
God are either sophistical or imaginative; as when, for example, the
bliss of the inhabitants of heaven is again circumscribed by limits,
and distributed into degrees, in order to establish a distinction
between God and the dwellers in heaven.</p>
<p>The identity of the divine and heavenly personality is apparent even
in the popular proofs of immortality. If there is not another and a
better life, God is not just and good. The justice and goodness of God
are thus made dependent on the perpetuity of individuals; but without
justice and goodness God is not God;&mdash;the Godhead, the existence
of God, is therefore made dependent on the existence of individuals. If
I am not immortal, I believe in no God; he who denies immortality
denies God. But that is impossible to me: as surely as there is a God,
so surely is there an immortality. God is the certainty of my future
felicity. The interest I have in knowing that <i>God is</i>, is one
with the interest I have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>in knowing that <i>I am</i>, that
I am immortal. God is my hidden, my assured existence; he is the
subjectivity of subjects, the personality of persons. How then should
that not belong to persons which belongs to personality? In God I make
my future into a present, or rather a verb into a substantive; how
should I separate the one from the other? God is the existence
corresponding to my wishes and feelings: he is the just one, the good,
who fulfils my wishes. Nature, this world, is an existence which
contradicts my wishes, my feelings. Here it is not as it ought to be;
this world passes away; but God is existence as it ought to be. God
fulfils my wishes;&mdash;this is only a popular personification of the
position: God is the fulfiller, <i>i.e.</i>, the reality, the

adequate to my wishes, my longing;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3789src"
href="#xd21e3789" name="xd21e3789src">3</a> thus there is no
distinction between God and heaven. God is the power by which man
realises his eternal happiness; God is the absolute personality in
which all individual persons have the certainty of their blessedness
and immortality; God is to subjectivity the highest, last certainty of
its absolute truth and essentiality.</p>
<p>The doctrine of immortality is the final doctrine of religion; its
testament, in which it declares its last wishes. Here therefore it
speaks out undisguisedly what it has hitherto suppressed. If elsewhere
the religious soul concerns itself with the existence of another being,
here it openly considers only its own existence; if elsewhere in
religion man makes his existence dependent on the existence of God, he
here makes the reality of God dependent on his own reality; and thus
what elsewhere is a primitive, immediate truth to him, is here a
derivative, secondary truth: if I am not immortal, God is not God; if
there is no immortality, there is no God;&mdash;a conclusion already
drawn by the Apostle Paul. If we do not rise again, then Christ is not
risen, and all is vain. Let us eat and drink. It is certainly possible
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>to do away with what is apparently or really
objectionable in the popular argumentation, by avoiding the inferential
form; but this can only be done by making immortality an analytic
instead of a synthetic truth, so as to show that the very idea of God
as absolute personality or subjectivity is <i>per se</i> the idea of
immortality. God is the guarantee of my future existence, because he is
already the certainty and reality of my present existence, my
salvation, my trust, my shield from the forces of the external world;
hence I need not expressly deduce immortality, or prove it as a
separate truth, for if I have God, I have immortality also. Thus it was
with the more profound Christian mystics; to them the idea of
immortality was involved in the idea of God; God was their immortal
life,&mdash;God himself their subjective blessedness: he was for them,
for their consciousness, what he is in himself, that is, in the essence
of religion.</p>
<p>Thus it is shown that God is heaven; that the two are identical. It
would have been easier to prove the converse, namely, that heaven is
the true God of men. As man conceives his heaven, so he conceives his
God; the content of his idea of heaven is the content of his idea of
God, only that what in God is a mere sketch, a concept, is in heaven
depicted and developed in the colours and forms of the senses. Heaven
is therefore the key to the deepest mysteries of religion. As heaven is
objectively the displayed nature of God, so subjectively it is the most
candid declaration of the inmost thoughts and dispositions of religion.
For this reason, religions are as various as are the kingdoms of
heaven, and there are as many different kingdoms of heaven as there are
characteristic differences among men. The Christians themselves have
very heterogeneous conceptions of heaven.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3801src" href="#xd21e3801" name="xd21e3801src">4</a></p>
<p>The more judicious among them, however, think and say nothing
definite about heaven or the future world in general, on the ground
that it is inconceivable, that it can only be thought of by us
according to the standard of this world, a standard not applicable to
the other. All conceptions of heaven here below are, they allege, mere
images, whereby <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176"
name="pb176">176</a>]</span>man represents to himself that future, the
nature of which is unknown to him, but the existence of which is
certain. It is just so with God. The existence of God, it is said, is
certain; but what he is, or how he exists, is inscrutable. But he who
speaks thus has already driven the future world out of his head; he
still holds it fast, either because he does not think at all about such
matters, or because it is still a want of his heart; but, preoccupied
with real things, he thrusts it as far as possible out of his sight; he
denies with his head what he affirms with his heart; for it is to deny
the future life, to deprive it of the qualities by which alone it is a
real and effective object for man. Quality is not distinct from
existence; quality is nothing but real existence. Existence without
quality is a chimera, a spectre. Existence is first made known to me by
quality; not existence first, and after that quality. The doctrines
that God is not to be known or defined, and that the nature of the
future life is inscrutable, are therefore not originally religious
doctrines; on the contrary, they are the products of irreligion while
still in bondage to religion, or rather hiding itself behind religion;
and they are so for this reason, that originally the existence of God
is posited only with a definite conception of God, the existence of a
future life only with a definite conception of that life. Thus to the
Christian, only his own paradise, the paradise which has Christian
qualities, is a certainty, not the paradise of the Mahometan or the
Elysium of the Greeks. The primary certainty is everywhere quality;
existence follows of course when once quality is certain. In the New
Testament we find no proofs or general propositions such as: there is a
God, there is a heavenly life; we find only qualities of the heavenly
life adduced;&mdash;&ldquo;in heaven they marry not.&rdquo;
Naturally;&mdash;it may be answered,&mdash;because the existence of God
and of heaven is presupposed. But here reflection introduces a
distinction of which the religious sentiment knows nothing. Doubtless
the existence is presupposed, but only because the quality is itself
existence, because the inviolate religious feeling lives only in the
quality, just as to the natural man the real existence, the thing in
itself, lies only in the quality which he perceives. Thus in the
passage above cited from the New Testament, the virgin or rather
sexless life is presupposed as the true life, which, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>however, necessarily becomes a future one,
because the actual life contradicts the ideal of the true life. But the
certainty of this future life lies only in the certainty of its
qualities, as those of the true, highest life, adequate to the
ideal.</p>
<p>Where the future life is really believed in, where it is a certain
life, there, precisely because it is certain, it is also definite. If I
know not now what and how I shall be; if there is an essential,
absolute difference between my future and my present; neither shall I
then know what and how I was before, the unity of consciousness is at
an end, personal identity is abolished, another being will appear in my
place; and thus my future existence is not in fact distinguished from
non-existence. If, on the other hand, there is no essential difference,
the future is to me an object that may be defined and known. And so it
is in reality. I am the abiding subject under changing conditions; I am
the substance which connects the present and the future into a unity.
How then can the future be obscure to me? On the contrary, the life of
this world is the dark, incomprehensible life, which only becomes clear
through the future life; here I am in disguise; there the mask will
fall; there I shall be as I am in truth. Hence the position that there
indeed is another, a heavenly life, but that <i>what</i> and <i>how</i>
it is must here remain inscrutable, is only an invention of religious
scepticism, which, being entirely alien to the religious sentiment,
proceeds upon a total misconception of religion. That which
irreligious-religious reflection converts into a known image of an
unknown yet certain thing, is originally, in the primitive, true sense
of religion, not an image, but the thing itself. Unbelief, in the garb
of belief, doubts the existence of the thing, but it is too shallow or
cowardly directly to call it in question; it only expresses doubt of
the image or conception, <i>i.e.</i>, declares the image to be only an
image. But the untruth and hollowness of this scepticism has been
already made evident historically. Where it is once doubted that the
images of immortality are real, that it is possible to exist as faith
conceives, for example, without a material, real body, and without
difference of sex; there the future existence in general is soon a
matter of doubt. With the image falls the thing, simply because the
image is the thing itself.</p>
<p>The belief in heaven, or in a future life in general, rests
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>on a mental judgment. It expresses praise and
blame; it selects a wreath from the flora of this world, and this
critical florilegium is heaven. That which man thinks beautiful, good,
agreeable, is for him what alone ought to be; that which he thinks bad,
odious, disagreeable, is what ought not to be; and hence, since it
nevertheless exists, it is condemned to destruction, it is regarded as
a negation. Where life is not in contradiction with a feeling, an
imagination, an idea, and where this feeling, this idea, is not held
authoritative and absolute, the belief in another and a heavenly life
does not arise. The future life is nothing else than life in unison
with the feeling, with the idea, which the present life contradicts.
The whole import of the future life is the abolition of this
discordance, and the realisation of a state which corresponds to the
feelings, in which man is in unison with himself. An unknown,
unimagined future is a ridiculous chimera: the other world is nothing
more than the reality of a known idea, the satisfaction of a conscious
desire, the fulfilment of a wish;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3832src"
href="#xd21e3832" name="xd21e3832src">5</a> it is only the removal of
limits which here oppose themselves to the realisation of the idea.
Where would be the consolation, where the significance of a future
life, if it were midnight darkness to me? No! from yonder world there
streams upon me with the splendour of virgin gold what here shines only
with the dimness of unrefined ore. The future world has no other
significance, no other basis of its existence, than the separation of
the metal from the admixture of foreign elements, the separation of the
good from the bad, of the pleasant from the unpleasant, of the
praiseworthy from the blamable. The future world is the <i>bridal</i>
in which man concludes his union with his beloved. Long has he loved
his bride, long has he yearned after her; but external relations, hard
reality, have stood in the way of his union to her. When the wedding
takes place, his beloved one does not become a different being; else
how could he so ardently long for her? She only becomes his own; from
an object of yearning and affectionate desire she becomes an object of
actual possession. It is true that here below, the other world is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>only an image, a conception; still it is not the
image of a remote, unknown thing, but a portrait of that which man
loves and prefers before all else. What man loves is his soul. The
heathens enclosed the ashes of the beloved dead in an urn; with the
Christian the heavenly future is the mausoleum in which he enshrines
his soul.</p>
<p>In order to comprehend a particular faith, or religion in general,
it is necessary to consider religion in its rudimentary stages, in its
lowest, rudest condition. Religion must not only be traced in an
ascending line, but surveyed in the entire course of its existence. It
is requisite to regard the various earlier religions as present in the
absolute religion, and not as left behind it in the past, in order
correctly to appreciate and comprehend the absolute religion as well as
the others. The most frightful &ldquo;aberrations,&rdquo; the wildest
excesses of the religious consciousness, often afford the profoundest
insight into the mysteries of the absolute religion. Ideas, seemingly
the rudest, are often only the most childlike, innocent, and true. This
observation applies to the conceptions of a future life. The
&ldquo;savage,&rdquo; whose consciousness does not extend beyond his
own country, whose entire being is a growth of its soil, takes his
country with him into the other world, either leaving Nature as it is,
or improving it, and so overcoming in the idea of the other life the
difficulties he experiences in this.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3842src" href="#xd21e3842" name="xd21e3842src">6</a> In this
limitation of uncultivated tribes there is a striking trait. With them
the future expresses nothing else than home-sickness. Death separates
man from his kindred, from his people, from his country. But the man
who has not extended his consciousness, cannot endure this separation;
he must come back again to his native land. The negroes in the West
Indies killed themselves that they might come to life again in their
fatherland. And, according to Ossian&rsquo;s conception, &ldquo;the
spirits of those who die in a strange land float back towards their
birthplace.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3848src" href=
"#xd21e3848" name="xd21e3848src">7</a> This limitation is the direct
opposite of imaginative spiritualism, which makes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>man
a vagabond, who, indifferent even to the earth, roams from star to
star; and certainly there lies a real truth at its foundation. Man is
what he is through Nature, however much may belong to his spontaneity;
for even his spontaneity has its foundation in Nature, of which his
particular character is only an expression. Be thankful to Nature! Man
cannot be separated from it. The German, whose God is spontaneity, owes
his character to Nature just as much as the Oriental. To find fault
with Indian art, with Indian religion and philosophy, is to find fault
with Indian Nature. You complain of the reviewer who tears a passage in
your works from the context that he may hand it over to ridicule. Why
are you yourself guilty of that which you blame in others? Why do you
tear the Indian religion from its connection, in which it is just as
reasonable as your absolute religion?</p>
<p>Faith in a future world, in a life after death, is therefore with
&ldquo;savage&rdquo; tribes essentially nothing more than direct faith
in the present life&mdash;immediate unbroken faith in this life. For
them, their actual life, even with its local limitations, has all, has
absolute value; they cannot abstract from it, they cannot conceive its
being broken off; <i>i.e.</i>, they believe directly in the infinitude,
the perpetuity of this life. Only when the belief in immortality
becomes a critical belief, when a distinction is made between what is
to be left behind here, and what is in reserve there, between what here
passes away, and what there is to abide, does the belief in life after
death form itself into the belief in another life; but this criticism,
this distinction, is applied to the present life also. Thus the
Christians distinguish between the natural and the Christian life, the
sensual or worldly and the spiritual or holy life. The heavenly life is
no other than that which is, already here below, distinguished from the
merely natural life, though still tainted with it. That which the
Christian excludes from himself now&mdash;for example, the sexual
life&mdash;is excluded from the future: the only distinction is, that
he is there free from that which he here wishes to be free from, and
seeks to rid himself of by the will, by devotion, and by bodily
mortification. Hence this life is, for the Christian, a life of torment
and pain, because he is here still beset by a hostile power, and has to
struggle with the lusts of the flesh and the assaults of the devil.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>The faith of cultured nations is therefore distinguished from that
of the uncultured in the same way that culture in general is
distinguished from inculture: namely, that the faith of culture is a
discriminating, critical, abstract faith. A distinction implies a
judgment; but where there is a judgment there arises the distinction
between positive and negative. The faith of savage tribes is a faith
without a judgment. Culture, on the contrary, judges: to the cultured
man only cultured life is the true life; to the Christian only the
Christian life. The rude child of Nature steps into the other life just
as he is, without ceremony: the other world is his natural nakedness.
The cultivated man, on the contrary, objects to the idea of such an
unbridled life after death, because even here he objects to the
unrestricted life of Nature. Faith in a future life is therefore only
faith in the true life of the present; the essential elements of this
life are also the essential elements of the other: accordingly, faith
in a future life is not faith in another unknown life; but in the truth
and infinitude, and consequently in the perpetuity, of that life which
already here below is regarded as the authentic life.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>As God is nothing else than the nature of man purified from that
which to the human individual appears, whether in feeling or thought, a
limitation, an evil; so the future life is nothing else than the
present life freed from that which appears a limitation or an evil. The
more definitely and profoundly the individual is conscious of the limit
as a limit, of the evil as an evil, the more definite and profound is
his conviction of the future life, where these limits disappear. The
future life is the feeling, the conception of freedom from those limits
which here circumscribe the feeling of self, the existence of the
individual. The only difference between the course of religion and that
of the natural or rational man is, that the end which the latter
arrives at by a straight line, the former only attains by describing a
curved line&mdash;a circle. The natural man remains at home because he
finds it agreeable, because he is perfectly satisfied; religion which
commences with a discontent, a disunion, forsakes its home and travels
far, but only to feel the more vividly in the distance the happiness of
home. In religion man separates himself from himself, but only to
return always to the same point <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182"
href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>from which he set out. Man
negatives himself, but only to posit himself again, and that in a
glorified form: he negatives this life, but only, in the end, to posit
it again in the future life.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3867src" href=
"#xd21e3867" name="xd21e3867src">8</a> The future life is this life
once lost, but found again, and radiant with all the more brightness
for the joy of recovery. The religious man renounces the joys of this
world, but only that he may win in return the joys of heaven; or rather
he renounces them because he is already in the ideal possession of
heavenly joys; and the joys of heaven are the same as those of earth,
only that they are freed from the limits and contrarieties of this
life. Religion thus arrives, though by a circuit, at the very goal, the
goal of joy, towards which the natural man hastens in a direct line. To
live in images or symbols is the essence of religion. Religion
sacrifices the thing itself to the image. The future life is the
present in the mirror of the imagination: the enrapturing image is in
the sense of religion the true type of earthly life,&mdash;real life
only a glimmer of that ideal, imaginary life. The future life is the
present embellished, contemplated through the imagination, purified
from all gross matter; or, positively expressed, it is the beauteous
present intensified.</p>
<p>Embellishment, emendation, presupposes blame, dissatisfaction. But
the dissatisfaction is only superficial. I do not deny the thing to be
of value; just as it is, however, it does not please me; I deny only
the modification, not the substance, otherwise I should urge
annihilation. A house which absolutely displeases me I cause to be
pulled down, not to be embellished. To the believer in a future life
joy is agreeable&mdash;who can fail to be conscious that joy is
something positive?&mdash;but it is disagreeable to him that here joy
is followed by opposite sensations, that it is transitory. Hence he
places joy in the future life also, but as eternal, uninterrupted,
divine joy (and the future life is therefore called the world of joy),
such as he here conceives it in God; for God is nothing but eternal,
uninterrupted joy, posited as a subject. Individuality or personality
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>is agreeable to him, but only as unencumbered by
objective forces; hence, he includes individuality also, but pure,
absolutely subjective individuality. Light pleases him; but not
gravitation, because this appears a limitation of the individual; not
night, because in it man is subjected to Nature: in the other world,
there is light, but no weight, no night,&mdash;pure, unobstructed
light.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3877src" href="#xd21e3877" name=
"xd21e3877src">9</a></p>
<p>As man in his utmost remoteness from himself, in God, always returns
upon himself, always revolves round himself; so in his utmost
remoteness from the world, he always at last comes back to it. The more
extra- and supra-human God appears at the commencement, the more human
does he show himself to be in the subsequent course of things, or at
the close: and just so, the more supernatural the heavenly life looks
in the beginning or at a distance, the more clearly does it, in the end
or when viewed closely, exhibit its identity with the natural
life,&mdash;an identity which at last extends even to the flesh, even
to the body. In the first instance the mind is occupied with the
separation of the soul from the body, as in the conception of God the
mind is first occupied with the separation of the essence from the
individual;&mdash;the individual dies a spiritual death, the dead body
which remains behind is the human individual; the soul which has
departed from it is God. But the separation of the soul from the body,
of the essence from the individual, of God from man, must be abolished
again. Every separation of beings essentially allied is painful. The
soul yearns after its lost half, after its body; as God, the departed
soul yearns after the real man. As, therefore, God becomes a man again,
so the soul returns to its body, and the perfect identity of this world
and the other is now restored. It is true that this new body is a
bright, glorified, miraculous body, but&mdash;and this is the main
point&mdash;it is another and yet the same body,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3882src" href="#xd21e3882" name="xd21e3882src">10</a> as God is
another being than man, and yet the same. Here we come again to the
idea of miracle, which unites contradictories. The supernatural body is
a body constructed by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>the imagination, for which very
reason it is adequate to the feelings of man: an unburdensome, purely
subjective body. Faith in the future life is nothing else than faith in
the truth of the imagination, as faith in God is faith in the truth and
infinity of human feeling. Or: as faith in God is only faith in the
abstract nature of man, so faith in the heavenly life is only faith in
the abstract earthly life.</p>
<p>But the sum of the future life is happiness, the everlasting bliss
of personality, which is here limited and circumscribed by Nature.
Faith in the future life is therefore faith in the freedom of
subjectivity from the limits of Nature; it is faith in the eternity and
infinitude of personality, and not of personality viewed in relation to
the idea of the species, in which it for ever unfolds itself in new
individuals, but of personality as belonging to already existing
individuals: consequently, it is the faith of man in himself. But faith
in the kingdom of heaven is one with faith in God&mdash;the content of
both ideas is the same; God is pure absolute subjectivity released from
all natural limits; he is what individuals ought to be and will be:
faith in God is therefore the faith of man in the infinitude and truth
of his own nature; the Divine Being is the subjective human being in
his absolute freedom and unlimitedness.</p>
<p>Our most essential task is now fulfilled. We have reduced the
supermundane, supernatural, and superhuman nature of God to the
elements of human nature as its fundamental elements. Our process of
analysis has brought us again to the position with which we set out.

<h2 class="main">THE ESSENTIAL STANDPOINT OF RELIGION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The essential standpoint of religion is the practical
or subjective. The end of religion is the welfare, the salvation, the
ultimate felicity of man; the relation of man to God is nothing else
than his relation to his own spiritual good; God is the realised
salvation of the soul, or the unlimited power of effecting the
salvation, the bliss of man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3909src" href=
"#xd21e3909" name="xd21e3909src">1</a> The Christian religion is
specially distinguished from other religions in this,&mdash;that no
other has given equal prominence to the salvation of man. But this
salvation is not temporal earthly prosperity and well-being. On the
contrary, the most genuine Christians have declared that earthly good
draws man away from God, whereas adversity, suffering, afflictions lead
him back to God, and hence are alone suited to Christians. Why? Because
in trouble man is only practically or subjectively disposed; in trouble
he has resource only to the one thing needful; in trouble God is felt
to be a want of man. Pleasure, joy, expands man; trouble, suffering,
contracts and concentrates him; in suffering man denies the reality of
the world; the things that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>charm the imagination of the
artist and the intellect of the thinker lose their attraction for him,
their power over him; he is absorbed in himself, in his own soul. The
soul thus self-absorbed, self-concentrated, seeking satisfaction in
itself alone, denying the world, idealistic in relation to the world,
to Nature in general, but realistic in relation to man, caring only for
its inherent need of salvation,&mdash;this soul is God. God, as the
object of religion,&mdash;and only as such is he God,&mdash;God in the
sense of a <i>nomen proprium</i>, not of a vague, metaphysical entity,
is essentially an object only of religion, not of philosophy,&mdash;of
feeling, not of the intellect,&mdash;of the heart&rsquo;s necessity,
not of the mind&rsquo;s freedom: in short, an object which is the
reflex not of the theoretical but of the practical tendency in man.</p>
<p>Religion annexes to its doctrines a curse and a blessing, damnation
and salvation. Blessed is he that believeth, cursed is he that
believeth not. Thus it appeals not to reason, but to feeling, to the
desire of happiness, to the passions of hope and fear. It does not take
the theoretic point of view; otherwise it must have been free to
enunciate its doctrines without attaching to them practical
consequences, without to a certain extent compelling belief in them;
for when the case stands thus: I am lost if I do not believe,&mdash;the
conscience is under a subtle kind of constraint; the fear of hell urges
me to believe. Even supposing my belief to be in its origin free, fear
inevitably intermingles itself; my conscience is always under
constraint; doubt, the principle of theoretic freedom, appears to me a
crime. And as in religion the highest idea, the highest existence is
God, so the highest crime is doubt in God, or the doubt that God
exists. But that which I do not trust myself to doubt, which I cannot
doubt without feeling disturbed in my soul, without incurring guilt;
that is no matter of theory, but a matter of conscience, no being of
the intellect, but of the heart.</p>
<p>Now as the sole standpoint of religion is the practical or
subjective standpoint, as therefore to religion the whole, the
essential man is that part of his nature which is practical, which
forms resolutions, which acts in accordance with conscious aims,
whether physical or moral, and which considers the world not in itself,
but only in relation to those aims or wants: the consequence is that
everything which lies behind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>the practical consciousness, but
which is the essential object of theory&mdash;theory in its most
original and general sense, namely, that of objective contemplation and
experience, of the intellect, of science<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3923src" href="#xd21e3923" name="xd21e3923src">2</a>&mdash;is
regarded by religion as lying outside man and Nature, in a special,
personal being. All good, but especially such as takes possession of
man apart from his volition, such as does not correspond with any
resolution or purpose, such as transcends the limits of the practical
consciousness, comes from God; all wickedness, evil, but especially
such as overtakes him against his will in the midst of his best moral
resolutions, or hurries him along with terrible violence, comes from
the devil. The scientific knowledge of the essence of religion includes
the knowledge of the devil, of Satan, of demons.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3929src" href="#xd21e3929" name="xd21e3929src">3</a> These things
cannot be omitted without a violent mutilation of religion. Grace and
its works are the antitheses of the devil and his works. As the
involuntary, sensual impulses which flash out from the depths of the
nature, and, in general, all those phenomena of moral and physical evil
which are inexplicable to religion, appear to it as the work of the
Evil Being; so the involuntary movements of inspiration and ecstasy
appear to it as the work of the Good Being, God, of the Holy Spirit or
of grace. Hence the arbitrariness of grace&mdash;the complaint of the
pious that grace at one time visits and blesses them, at another
forsakes and rejects them. The life, the agency of grace, is the life,
the agency of emotion. Emotion is the Paraclete of Christians. The
moments which are forsaken by divine grace are the moments destitute of
emotion and inspiration.</p>
<p>In relation to the inner life, grace may be defined as <i>religious
genius</i>; in relation to the outer life as <i>religious chance</i>.
Man is good or wicked by no means through himself, his own power, his
will; but through that complete synthesis of hidden and evident
determinations of things <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href=
"#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>which, because they rest on no
evident necessity, we ascribe to the power of &ldquo;chance.&rdquo;
Divine grace is the power of chance beclouded with additional mystery.
Here we have again the confirmation of that which we have seen to be
the essential law of religion. Religion denies, repudiates chance,
making everything dependent on God, explaining everything by means of
him; but this denial is only apparent; it merely gives chance the name
of the divine sovereignty. For the divine will, which, on
incomprehensible grounds, for incomprehensible reasons, that is,
speaking plainly, out of groundless, absolute arbitrariness, out of
divine caprice, as it were, determines or predestines some to evil and
misery, others to good and happiness, has not a single positive
characteristic to distinguish it from the power of chance. The mystery
of the election of grace is thus the mystery of chance. I say the
<i>mystery</i> of chance; for in reality chance is a mystery, although
slurred over and ignored by our speculative religious philosophy,
which, as in its occupation with the illusory mysteries of the Absolute
Being, <i>i.e.</i>, of theology, it has overlooked the true mysteries
of thought and life, so also in the mystery of divine grace or freedom
of election, has forgotten the profane mystery of chance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3955src" href="#xd21e3955" name=
"xd21e3955src">4</a></p>
<p>But to return. The devil is the negative, the evil, that springs
from the nature, but not from the will; God is the positive, the good,
which comes from the nature, but not from the conscious action of the
will; the devil is involuntary, inexplicable wickedness; God
involuntary, inexplicable goodness. The source of both is the same, the
quality only is different or opposite. For this reason, the belief in a
devil was, until the most recent times, intimately connected with the
belief in God, so that the denial of the devil was held to be virtually
as atheistic as the denial of God. Nor without reason; for when men
once begin to derive the phenomena of evil from natural causes, they at
the same time begin to derive the phenomena of good, of the divine,
from the nature of things, and come at length either to abolish the
idea of God altogether, or at least to believe in another God than the
God of religion. In this case it most commonly happens <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>that
they make the Deity an idle inactive being, whose existence is
equivalent to non-existence, since he no longer actively interposes in
life, but is merely placed at the summit of things, at the beginning of
the world, as the First Cause. God created the world: this is all that
is here retained of God. The past tense is necessary; for since that
epoch the world pursues its course like a machine. The addition: He
still creates, he is creating at this moment, is only the result of
external reflection; the past tense adequately expresses the religious
idea in this stage; for the spirit of religion is gone when the
operation of God is reduced to a <i>fecit</i> or <i>creavit</i>. It is
otherwise when the genuine religious consciousness says: The
<i>fecit</i> is still to-day a <i>facit</i>. This, though here also it
is a product of reflection, has nevertheless a legitimate meaning,
because by the religious spirit God is really thought of as active.</p>
<p>Religion is abolished where the idea of the world, of so-called
second causes, intrudes itself between God and man. Here a foreign
element, the principle of intellectual culture, has insinuated itself,
peace is broken, the harmony of religion, which lies only in the
immediate connection of man with God, is destroyed. Second causes are a
capitulation of the unbelieving intellect with the still believing
heart. It is true that, according to religion also, God works on man by
means of other things and beings. But God alone is the cause, he alone
is the active and efficient being. What a fellow-creature does is in
the view of religion done not by him, but by God. The other is only an
appearance, a medium, a vehicle, not a cause. But the &ldquo;second
cause&rdquo; is a miserable anomaly, neither an independent nor a
dependent being: God, it is true, gives the first impulse, but then
ensues the spontaneous activity of the second cause.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3976src" href="#xd21e3976" name="xd21e3976src">5</a></p>
<p>Religion of itself, unadulterated by foreign elements, knows nothing
of the existence of second causes; on the contrary, they are a stone of
stumbling to it; for the realm of second causes, the sensible world,
Nature, is precisely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190"
name="pb190">190</a>]</span>what separates man from God, although God
as a real God, <i>i.e.</i>, an external being, is supposed himself to
become in the other world a sensible existence.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3992src" href="#xd21e3992" name="xd21e3992src">6</a> Hence
religion believes that one day this wall of separation will fall away.
One day there will be no Nature, no matter, no body, at least none such
as to separate man from God: then there will be only God and the pious
soul. Religion derives the idea of the existence of second causes, that
is, of things which are interposed between God and man, only from the
physical, natural, and hence the irreligious or at least non-religious
theory of the universe: a theory which it nevertheless immediately
subverts by making the operations of Nature operations of God. But this
religious idea is in contradiction with the natural sense and
understanding, which concedes a real, spontaneous activity to natural
things. And this contradiction of the physical view with the religious
theory, religion resolves by converting the undeniable activity of
things into an activity of God. Thus, on this view, the positive idea
is God; the negative, the world.</p>
<p>On the contrary, where second causes, having been set in motion,
are, so to speak, emancipated, the converse occurs; Nature is the
positive, God a negative idea. The world is independent in its
existence, its persistence; only as to its commencement is it
dependent. God is here only a hypothetical Being, an inference, arising
from the necessity of a limited understanding, to which the existence
of a world viewed by it as a machine is inexplicable without a
self-moving principle;&mdash;he is no longer an original, absolutely
necessary Being. God exists not for his own sake, but for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>the
sake of the world,&mdash;merely that he may, as a First Cause, explain
the existence of the world. The narrow rationalising man takes
objection to the original self-subsistence of the world, because he
looks at it only from the subjective, practical point of view, only in
its commoner aspect, only as a piece of mechanism, not in its majesty
and glory, not as the Cosmos. He conceives the world as having been
launched into existence by an original impetus, as, according to
mathematical theory, is the case with matter once set in motion and
thenceforth going on for ever: that is, he postulates a mechanical
origin. A machine must have a beginning; this is involved in its very
idea; for it has not the source of motion in itself.</p>
<p>All religious speculative cosmogony is tautology, as is apparent
from this example. In cosmogony man declares or realises the idea he
has of the world; he merely repeats what he has already said in another
form. Thus here, if the world is a machine, it is self-evident that it
did not make itself, that, on the contrary, it was created,
<i>i.e.</i>, had a mechanical origin. Herein, it is true, the religious
consciousness agrees with the mechanical theory, that to it also the
world is a mere fabric, a product of Will. But they agree only for an
instant, only in the moment of creation; that moment past, the harmony
ceases. The holder of the mechanical theory needs God only as the
creator of the world; once made, the world turns its back on the
Creator, and rejoices in its godless self-subsistence. But religion
creates the world only to maintain it in the perpetual consciousness of
its nothingness, its dependence on God.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4013src" href="#xd21e4013" name="xd21e4013src">7</a> To the
mechanical theorist, the creation is the last thin thread which yet
ties him to religion; the religion to which the nothingness of the
world is a present truth (for all power and activity is to it the power
and activity of God), is with him only a surviving reminiscence of
youth; hence he removes the creation of the world, the act of religion,
the non-existence of the world (for in the beginning, before the
creation, there was no world, only God), <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>into the far
distance, into the past, while the self-subsistence of the world, which
absorbs all his senses and endeavours, acts on him with the force of
the present. The mechanical theorist interrupts and cuts short the
activity of God by the activity of the world. With him God has indeed
still an historical right, but this is in contradiction with the right
he awards to Nature; hence he limits as much as possible the right yet
remaining to God, in order to gain wider and freer play for his natural
causes, and thereby for his understanding.</p>
<p>With this class of thinkers the creation holds the same position as
miracles, which also they can and actually do acquiesce in, because
miracles exist, at least according to religious opinion. But not to say
that he explains miracles naturally, that is, mechanically, he can only
digest them when he relegates them to the past; for the present he begs
to be excused from believing in them, and explains everything to
himself charmingly on natural principles. When a belief has departed
from the reason, the intelligence, when it is no longer held
spontaneously, but merely because it is a common belief, or because on
some ground or other it must be held; in short, when a belief is
inwardly a past one; then externally also the object of the belief is
referred to the past. Unbelief thus gets breathing space, but at the
same time concedes to belief at least an historical validity. The past
is here the fortunate means of compromise between belief and unbelief:
I certainly believe in miracles, but, <i>nota bene</i>, in no miracles
which happen now&mdash;only in those which once happened, which, thank
God! are already <i lang="la">plus quam perfecta</i>. So also with the
creation. The creation is an immediate act of God, a miracle, for there
was once nothing but God. In the idea of the creation man transcends
the world, he rises into abstraction from it; he conceives it as
non-existent in the moment of creation; thus he dispels from his sight
what stands between himself and God, the sensible world; he places
himself in immediate contact with God. But the mechanical thinker
shrinks from this immediate contact with God; hence he at once makes
the <i>pr&aelig;sens</i>, if indeed he soars so high, into a
<i>perfectum</i>; he interposes millenniums between his natural or
materialistic view and the thought of an immediate operation of
God.</p>
<p>To the religious spirit, on the contrary, God alone is the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>cause of all positive effects, God alone the
ultimate and also the sole ground wherewith it answers, or rather
repels, all questions which theory puts forward; for the affirmative of
religion is virtually a negative; its answer amounts to nothing, since
it solves the most various questions always with the same answer,
making all the operations of Nature immediate operations of God, of a
designing, personal, extra-natural or supranatural Being. God is the
idea which supplies the lack of theory. The idea of God is the
explanation of the inexplicable,&mdash;which explains nothing because
it is supposed to explain everything without distinction; he is the
night of theory, a night, however, in which everything is clear to
religious feeling, because in it the measure of darkness, the
discriminating light of the understanding, is extinct; he is the
ignorance which solves all doubt by repressing it, which knows
everything because it knows nothing definite, because all things which
impress the intellect disappear before religion, lose their
individuality, in the eyes of divine power are nothing. Darkness is the
mother of religion.</p>
<p>The essential act of religion, that in which religion puts into
action what we have designated as its essence, is prayer. Prayer is
all-powerful. What the pious soul entreats for in prayer God fulfils.
But he prays not for spiritual gifts<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4039src" href="#xd21e4039" name="xd21e4039src">8</a> alone, which
lie in some sort in the power of man; he prays also for things which
lie out of him, which are in the power of Nature, a power which it is
the very object of prayer to overcome; in prayer he lays hold on a
supernatural means, in order to attain ends in themselves natural. God
is to him not the <i lang="la">causa remota</i> but the <i lang=
"la">causa proxima</i>, the immediate, efficient cause of all natural
effects. All so-called secondary forces and second causes are nothing
to him when he prays; if they were anything to him, the might, the
fervour of prayer would be annihilated. But in fact they have no
existence for him; otherwise he would assuredly seek to attain his end
only by some intermediate process. But he desires immediate help. He
has recourse to prayer in the certainty that he can do more, infinitely
more, by prayer, than by all the efforts of reason and all the agencies
of Nature,&mdash;in the conviction that prayer possesses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>superhuman and supernatural powers.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4050src" href="#xd21e4050" name="xd21e4050src">9</a>
But in prayer he applies immediately to God. Thus God is to him the
<i>immediate</i> cause, the fulfilment of prayer, the power which
realises prayer. But an immediate act of God is a miracle; hence
miracle is essential to the religious view. Religion explains
everything miraculously. That miracles do not always happen is indeed
obvious, as that man does not always pray. But the consideration that
miracles do not always happen lies outside the nature of religion, in
the empirical or physical mode of view only. Where religion begins,
there also begins miracle. Every true prayer is a miracle, an act of
the wonder-working power. External miracles themselves only make
visible internal miracles, that is, they are only a manifestation in
time and space, and therefore as a special fact, of what in and by
itself is a fundamental position of religion, namely, that God is, in
general, the supernatural, immediate cause of all things. The miracle
of fact is only an impassioned expression of religion, a moment of
inspiration. Miracles happen only in extraordinary crises, in which
there is an exaltation of the feelings: hence there are miracles of
anger. No miracle is wrought in cold blood. But it is precisely in
moments of passion that the latent nature reveals itself. Man does not
always pray with equal warmth and power. Such prayers are therefore
ineffective. Only ardent prayer reveals the nature of prayer. Man truly
prays when he regards prayer as in itself a sacred power, a divine
force. So it is with miracles. Miracles happen&mdash;no matter whether
few or many&mdash;wherever there is, as a basis for them, a belief in
the miraculous. But the belief in miracle is no theoretic or objective
mode of viewing the world and Nature; miracle realises practical wants,
and that in contradiction with the laws which are imperative to the
reason; in miracle man subjugates Nature, as in itself a nullity, to
his own ends, which he regards as a reality; miracle is the superlative
expression of spiritual or religious utilitarianism; in miracle all
things are at the service of necessitous man. It is clear <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>from
this, that the conception of the world which is essential to religion
is that of the practical or subjective standpoint, that God&mdash;for
the miracle-working power is identical with God&mdash;is a purely
practical or subjective Being, serving, however, as a substitute for a
theoretic view, and is thus no object of thought, of the knowing
faculty, any more than miracle, which owes its origin to the negation
of thought. If I place myself in the point of view of thought, of
investigation, of theory, in which I consider things in themselves, in
their mutual relations, the miracle-working being vanishes into
nothing, miracle disappears; <i>i.e.</i>, the religious miracle, which
is absolutely different from the natural miracle, though they are
continually interchanged, in order to stultify reason, and, under the
appearance of natural science, to introduce religious miracle into the
sphere of rationality and reality.</p>
<p>But for this very reason&mdash;namely, that religion is removed from
the standpoint, from the nature of theory&mdash;the true, universal
essence of Nature and humanity, which as such is hidden from religion
and is only visible to the theoretic eye, is conceived as another, a
miraculous and supernatural essence; the idea of the species becomes
the idea of God, who again is himself an individual being, but is
distinguished from human individuals in this, that he possesses their
qualities according to the measure of the species. Hence, in religion
man necessarily places his nature out of himself, regards his nature as
a separate nature; necessarily, because the nature which is the object
of theory lies outside of him, because all his conscious existence
spends itself in his practical subjectivity. God is his <i>alter
ego</i>, his other lost half; God is the complement of himself; in God
he is first a perfect man. God is a need to him; something is wanting
to him without his knowing what it is&mdash;God is this something
wanting, indispensable to him; God belongs to his nature. The world is
nothing to religion,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4067src" href=
"#xd21e4067" name="xd21e4067src">10</a>&mdash;the world, which is in
truth the sum of all reality, is revealed in its glory only by theory.
The joys of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>theory are the sweetest intellectual pleasures
of life; but religion knows nothing of the joys of the thinker, of the
investigator of Nature, of the artist. The idea of the universe is
wanting to it, the consciousness of the really infinite, the
consciousness of the species. God only is its compensation for the
poverty of life, for the want of a substantial import, which the true
life of rational contemplation presents in unending fulness. God is to
religion the substitute for the lost world,&mdash;God is to it in the
stead of pure contemplation, the life of theory.</p>
<p>That which we have designated as the practical or subjective view is
not pure, it is tainted with egoism, for therein I have relation to a
thing only for my own sake; neither is it self-sufficing, for it places
me in relation to an object above my own level. On the contrary, the
theoretic view is joyful, self-sufficing, happy; for here the object
calls forth love and admiration; in the light of the free intelligence
it is radiant as a diamond, transparent as a rock-crystal. The
theoretic view is &aelig;sthetic, whereas the practical is
un&aelig;sthetic. Religion therefore finds in God a compensation for
the want of an &aelig;sthetic view. To the religious spirit the world
is nothing in itself; the admiration, the contemplation of it is
idolatry; for the world is a mere piece of mechanism.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4074src" href="#xd21e4074" name="xd21e4074src">11</a> Hence in
religion it is God that serves as the object of pure, untainted,
<i>i.e.</i>, theoretic or &aelig;sthetic contemplation. God is the
existence to which the religious man has an objective relation; in God
the object is contemplated by him for its own sake. God is an end in
himself; therefore in religion he has the significance which in the
theoretic view belongs to the object in general. The general being of
theory is to religion a special being. It is true that in religion man,
in his relation to God, has relation to his own wants as well in a
higher as in the lower sense: &ldquo;Give us this day our daily
bread;&rdquo; but God can satisfy all wants of man only because he in
himself has no wants,&mdash;because he is perfect blessedness.

God and Nature, which runs through the history of Christianity. On the

life, as has been already said, nothing but the true opinion and
disposition, the open heart, of religion. Here we believe&mdash;there
we behold; <i>i.e.</i>, <i>there</i> there is nothing besides God, and
thus nothing between God and the soul; but only for this reason, that
there ought to be nothing between them, because the immediate union of
God and the soul is the true opinion and desire of religion. &ldquo;We
have as yet so to do with God as with one hidden from us, and it is not
possible that in this life we should hold communion with him face to

power, a charm. But this conception is an unchristian one (although
even among many Christians the idea is accepted that prayer constrains
God); for in Christianity God is essentially feeling satisfied in
itself, Almighty goodness, which denies nothing to (religious) feeling.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE CONTRADICTION IN THE EXISTENCE OF GOD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Religion is the relation of man to his own
nature,&mdash;therein lies its truth and its power of moral
amelioration;&mdash;but to his nature not recognised as his own, but
regarded as another nature, separate, nay, contradistinguished from his
own: herein lies its untruth, its limitation, its contradiction to
reason and morality; herein lies the noxious source of religious
fanaticism, the chief metaphysical principle of human sacrifices, in a
word, the <i>prima materia</i> of all the atrocities, all the horrible
scenes, in the tragedy of religious history.</p>
<p>The contemplation of the human nature as another, a separately
existent nature, is, however, in the original conception of religion an
involuntary, childlike, simple act of the mind, that is, one which
separates God and man just as immediately as it again identifies them.
But when religion advances in years, and, with years, in understanding;
when, within the bosom of religion, reflection on religion is awakened,
and the consciousness of the identity of the divine being with the
human begins to dawn,&mdash;in a word, when religion becomes theology,
the originally involuntary and harmless separation of God from man
becomes an intentional, excogitated separation, which has no other
object than to banish again from the consciousness this identity which
has already entered there.</p>
<p>Hence the nearer religion stands to its origin, the truer, the more
genuine it is, the less is its true nature disguised; that is to say,
in the origin of religion there is no qualitative or essential
distinction whatever between God and man. And the religious man is not
shocked at this identification; for his understanding is still in
harmony with his religion. Thus in ancient Judaism, Jehovah was a being
differing from the human individual in nothing but in duration of
existence; in his qualities, his inherent nature, he was entirely
similar to man,&mdash;had the same passions, the same human, nay, even
corporeal properties. Only in the later <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>Judaism was Jehovah
separated in the strictest manner from man, and recourse was had to
allegory in order to give to the old anthropomorphisms another sense
than that which they originally had. So again in Christianity: in its
earliest records the divinity of Christ is not so decidedly stamped as
it afterwards became. With Paul especially, Christ is still an
undefined being, hovering between heaven and earth, between God and
man, or in general, one amongst the existences subordinate to the
highest,&mdash;the first of the angels, the first created, but still
created; begotten indeed for our sake; but then neither are angels and
men created, but begotten, for God is their Father also. The Church
first identified him with God, made him the exclusive Son of God,
defined his distinction from men and angels, and thus gave him the
monopoly of an eternal, uncreated existence.</p>
<p>In the genesis of ideas, the first mode in which reflection on
religion, or theology, makes the divine being a distinct being, and
places him outside of man, is by making the existence of God the object
of a formal proof.</p>
<p>The proofs of the existence of God have been pronounced
contradictory to the essential nature of religion. They are so, but
only in their form as proofs. Religion immediately represents the inner
nature of man as an objective, external being. And the proof aims at
nothing more than to prove that religion is right. The most perfect
being is that than which no higher can be conceived: God is the highest
that man conceives or can conceive. This premiss of the ontological
proof&mdash;the most interesting proof, because it proceeds from
within&mdash;expresses the inmost nature of religion. That which is the
highest for man, from which he can make no further abstraction, which
is the positive limit of his intellect, of his feeling, of his
sentiment, that is to him God&mdash;<i lang="la">id quo nihil majus
cogitari potest</i>. But this highest being would not be the highest if
he did not exist; we could then conceive a higher being who would be
superior to him in the fact of existence; the idea of the highest being
directly precludes this fiction. Not to exist is a deficiency; to exist
is perfection, happiness, bliss. From a being to whom man gives all,
offers up all that is precious to him, he cannot withhold the bliss of
existence. The contradiction to the religious spirit in the proof of
the existence of God lies only in this, that the existence is thought
of separately, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199"
name="pb199">199</a>]</span>thence arises the appearance that God is a
mere conception, a being existing in idea only,&mdash;an appearance,
however, which is immediately dissipated; for the very result of the
proof is, that to God belongs an existence distinct from an ideal one,
an existence apart from man, apart from thought,&mdash;a real
self-existence.</p>
<p>The proof therefore is only thus far discordant with the spirit of
religion, that it presents as a formal deduction the implicit enthymeme
or immediate conclusion of religion, exhibits in logical relation, and
therefore distinguishes, what religion immediately unites; for to
religion God is not a matter of abstract thought,&mdash;he is a present
truth and reality. But that every religion in its idea of God makes a
latent, unconscious inference, is confessed in its polemic against
other religions. &ldquo;Ye heathens,&rdquo; says the Jew or the
Christian, &ldquo;were able to conceive nothing higher as your deities
because ye were sunk in sinful desires. Your God rests on a conclusion,
the premisses of which are your sensual impulses, your passions. You
thought thus: the most excellent life is to live out one&rsquo;s
impulses without restraint; and because this life was the most
excellent, the truest, you made it your God. Your God was your carnal
nature, your heaven only a free theatre for the passions which, in
society and in the conditions of actual life generally, had to suffer
restraint.&rdquo; But, naturally, in relation to itself no religion is
conscious of such an inference, for the highest of which it is capable
is its limit, has the force of necessity, is not a thought, not a
conception, but immediate reality.</p>
<p>The proofs of the existence of God have for their aim to make the
internal external, to separate it from man.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4117src" href="#xd21e4117" name="xd21e4117src">1</a> His
existence being proved, God is no longer a merely relative, but a
noumenal being (<i lang="de">Ding an sich</i>): he is not only a being
for us, a being in our faith, our feeling, our nature, he is a being in
himself, a being external to us,&mdash;in a word, not merely a belief,
a feeling, a thought, but also a real existence apart from belief,
feeling, and thought. But such an existence is no other than a
sensational existence; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span><i>i.e.</i>, an existence
conceived according to the forms of our senses.</p>
<p>The idea of sensational existence is indeed already involved in the
characteristic expression &ldquo;external to us.&rdquo; It is true that
a sophistical theology refuses to interpret the word
&ldquo;external&rdquo; in its proper, natural sense, and substitutes
the indefinite expression of independent, separate existence. But if
the externality is only figurative, the existence also is figurative.
And yet we are here only concerned with existence in the proper sense,
and external existence is alone the definite, real, unshrinking
expression for separate existence.</p>
<p>Real, sensational existence is that which is not dependent on my own
mental spontaneity or activity, but by which I am involuntarily
affected, which is when I am not, when I do not think of it or feel it.
The existence of God must therefore be in space&mdash;in general, a
qualitative, sensational existence. But God is not seen, not heard, not
perceived by the senses. He does not exist for me, if I do not exist
for him; if I do not believe in a God, there is no God for me. If I am
not devoutly disposed, if I do not raise myself above the life of the
senses, he has no place in my consciousness. Thus he exists only in so
far as he is felt, thought, believed in;&mdash;the addition &ldquo;for
me&rdquo; is unnecessary. His existence therefore is a real one, yet at
the same time not a real one;&mdash;a spiritual existence, says the
theologian. But spiritual existence is only an existence in thought, in
feeling, in belief; so that his existence is a medium between
sensational existence and conceptional existence, a medium full of
contradiction. Or: he is a sensational existence, to which however all
the conditions of sensational existence are wanting:&mdash;consequently
an existence at once sensational and not sensational, an existence
which contradicts the idea of the sensational, or only a vague
existence in general, which is fundamentally a sensational one, but
which, in order that this may not become evident, is divested of all
the predicates of a real, sensational existence. But such an
&ldquo;existence in general&rdquo; is self-contradictory. To existence
belongs full, definite reality.</p>
<p>A necessary consequence of this contradiction is Atheism. The
existence of God is essentially an empirical existence, without having
its distinctive marks; it is in itself a matter of experience, and yet
in reality no object of experience. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>calls upon man to
seek it in Reality: it impregnates his mind with sensational
conceptions and pretensions; hence, when these are not
fulfilled&mdash;when, on the contrary, he finds experience in
contradiction with these conceptions, he is perfectly justified in
denying that existence.</p>
<p>Kant is well known to have maintained, in his critique of the proofs
of the existence of God, that that existence is not susceptible of
proof from reason. He did not merit, on this account, the blame which
was cast on him by Hegel. The idea of the existence of God in those
proofs is a thoroughly empirical one; but I cannot deduce empirical
existence from an <i>&agrave; priori</i> idea. The only real ground of
blame against Kant is, that in laying down this position he supposed it
to be something remarkable, whereas it is self-evident. Reason cannot
constitute itself an object of sense. I cannot, in thinking, at the
same time represent what I think as a sensible object, external to me.
The proof of the existence of God transcends the limits of the reason;
true; but in the same sense in which sight, hearing, smelling transcend
the limits of the reason. It is absurd to reproach reason that it does
not satisfy a demand which can only address itself to the senses.
Existence, empirical existence, is proved to me by the senses alone;
and in the question as to the being of God, the existence implied has
not the significance of inward reality, of truth, but the significance
of a formal, external existence. Hence there is perfect truth in the
allegation that the belief that God is or is not has no consequence
with respect to inward moral dispositions. It is true that the thought:
There is a God, is inspiring; but here the <i>is</i> means inward
reality; here the existence is a movement of inspiration, an act of
aspiration. Just in proportion as this existence becomes a prosaic, an
empirical truth, the inspiration is extinguished.</p>
<p>Religion, therefore, in so far as it is founded on the existence of
God as an empirical truth, is a matter of indifference to the inward
disposition. As, necessarily, in the religious cultus, ceremonies,
observances, sacraments, apart from the moral spirit or disposition,
become in themselves an important fact: so also, at last, belief in the
existence of God becomes, apart from the inherent quality, the
spiritual import of the idea of God, a chief point in religion. If thou
only believest in God&mdash;believest that God is, thou art
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>already saved. Whether under this God thou
conceivest a really divine being or a monster, a Nero or a Caligula, an
image of thy passions, thy revenge, or ambition, it is all
one,&mdash;the main point is that thou be not an atheist. The history
of religion has amply confirmed this consequence which we here draw
from the idea of the divine existence. If the existence of God, taken
by itself, had not rooted itself as a religious truth in minds, there
would never have been those infamous, senseless, horrible ideas of God
which stigmatise the history of religion and theology. The existence of
God was a common, external, and yet at the same time a holy
thing:&mdash;what wonder, then, if on this ground the commonest,
rudest, most unholy conceptions and opinions sprang up!</p>
<p>Atheism was supposed, and is even now supposed, to be the negation
of all moral principle, of all moral foundations and bonds: if God is
not, all distinction between good and bad, virtue and vice, is
abolished. Thus the distinction lies only in the existence of God; the
reality of virtue lies not in itself, but out of it. And assuredly it
is not from an attachment to virtue, from a conviction of its intrinsic
worth and importance, that the reality of it is thus bound up with the
existence of God. On the contrary, the belief that God is the necessary
condition of virtue is the belief in the nothingness of virtue in
itself.</p>
<p>It is indeed worthy of remark that the idea of the empirical
existence of God has been perfectly developed in modern times, in which
empiricism and materialism in general have arrived at their full blow.
It is true that even in the original, simple religious mind, God is an
empirical existence to be found in a place, though above the earth. But
here this conception has not so naked, so prosaic a significance; the
imagination identifies again the external God with the soul of man. The
imagination is, in general, the true place of an existence which is
absent, not present to the senses, though nevertheless sensational in
its essence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4152src" href="#xd21e4152"
name="xd21e4152src">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>Only the imagination solves the
contradiction in an existence which is at once sensational and not
sensational; only the imagination is the preservative from atheism. In
the imagination existence has sensational effects,&mdash;existence
affirms itself as a power; with the essence of sensational existence
the imagination associates also the phenomena of sensational existence.
Where the existence of God is a living truth, an object on which the
imagination exercises itself, there also appearances of God are
believed in.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4159src" href="#xd21e4159"
name="xd21e4159src">3</a> Where, on the contrary, the fire of the
religious imagination is extinct, where the sensational effects or
appearances necessarily connected with an essentially sensational
existence cease, there the existence becomes a dead, self-contradictory
existence, which falls irrecoverably into the negation of atheism.</p>
<p>The belief in the existence of God is the belief in a special
existence, separate from the existence of man and Nature. A special
existence can only be proved in a special manner. This faith is
therefore only <i>then</i> a true and living one when special effects,
immediate appearances of God, miracles, are believed in. Where, on the
other hand, the belief in God is identified with the belief in the
world, where the belief in God is no longer a special faith, where the
general being of the world takes possession of the whole man, there
also vanishes the belief in special effects and appearances of God.
Belief in God is wrecked, is stranded on the belief in the world, in
natural effects as the only true ones. As here the belief in miracles
is no longer anything more than the belief in historical, past
miracles, so the existence of God is also only an historical, in itself
atheistic conception. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=

same time, however, their result is to prove the nature of man. The
various proofs of the existence of God are nothing else than various
highly interesting forms in which the human nature affirms itself.
Thus, for example, the physico-theological proof (or proof from design)
is the self-affirmation of the calculated activity of the

<h2 class="main">THE CONTRADICTION IN THE REVELATION OF GOD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With the idea of the existence of God is connected the
idea of revelation. God&rsquo;s attestation of his existence, the
authentic testimony that God exists, is revelation. Proofs drawn from
reason are merely subjective; the objective, the only true proof of the
existence of God, is his revelation. God speaks to man; revelation is
the word of God; he sends forth a voice which thrills the soul, and
gives it the joyful certainty that God really is. The word is the
gospel of life,&mdash;the criterion of existence and non-existence.
Belief in revelation is the culminating point of religious objectivism.
The subjective conviction of the existence of God here becomes an
indubitable, external, historical fact. The existence of God, in
itself, considered simply as existence, is already an external,
empirical existence; still, it is as yet only thought, conceived, and
therefore doubtful; hence the assertion that all proofs produce no
satisfactory certainty. This conceptional existence converted into a
real existence, a fact, is revelation. God has revealed himself, has
demonstrated himself: who then can have any further doubt? The
certainty of the existence of God is involved for me in the certainty
of the revelation. A God who only exists without revealing himself, who
exists for me only through my own mental act, such a God is a merely
abstract, imaginary, subjective God; a God who gives me a knowledge of
himself through his own act is alone a God who truly exists, who proves
himself to exist,&mdash;an objective God. Faith in revelation is the
immediate certainty of the religious mind, that what it believes,
wishes, conceives, really is. Religion is a dream, in which our own
conceptions and emotions appear to us as separate existences, beings
out of ourselves. The religious mind does not distinguish between
subjective and objective,&mdash;it has no doubts; it has the faculty,
not of discerning other things than itself, but of seeing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>its
own conceptions out of itself as distinct beings. What is in itself a
mere theory is to the religious mind a practical belief, a matter of
conscience,&mdash;a fact. A fact is that which from being an object of
the intellect becomes a matter of conscience; a fact is that which one
cannot criticise or attack without being guilty of a crime;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4178src" href="#xd21e4178" name="xd21e4178src">1</a>
a fact is that which one must believe <i>nolens volens</i>; a fact is a
physical force, not an argument,&mdash;it makes no appeal to the
reason. O ye shortsighted religious philosophers of Germany, who fling
at our heads the facts of the religious consciousness, to stun our
reason and make us the slaves of your childish superstition,&mdash;do
you not see that facts are just as relative, as various, as subjective,
as the ideas of the different religions? Were not the gods of Olympus
also facts, self-attesting existences?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4190src" href="#xd21e4190" name="xd21e4190src">2</a> Were not the
ludicrous miracles of paganism regarded as facts? Were not angels and
demons historical persons? Did they not really appear to men? Did not
Balaam&rsquo;s ass really speak? Was not the story of Balaam&rsquo;s
ass just as much believed even by enlightened scholars of the last
century, as the Incarnation or any other miracle? A fact, I repeat, is
a conception about the truth of which there is no doubt, because it is
no object of theory, but of feeling, which desires that what it wishes,
what it believes, should be true. A fact is that, the denial of which
is forbidden, if not by an external law, yet by an internal one. A fact
is every possibility which passes for a reality, every conception
which, for the age wherein it is held to be a fact, expresses a want,
and is for that reason an impassable limit of the mind. A fact is every
wish that projects itself on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href=
"#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>reality: in short, it is
everything that is not doubted simply because it is not&mdash;must not
be&mdash;doubted.</p>
<p>The religious mind, according to its nature as hitherto unfolded,
has the immediate certainty that all its involuntary, spontaneous
affections are impressions from without, manifestations of another
being. The religious mind makes itself the passive, God the active
being. God is activity; but that which determines him to activity,
which causes his activity (originally only omnipotence,
<i>potentia</i>) to become real activity, is not himself,&mdash;he
needs nothing,&mdash;but man, the religious subject. At the same time,
however, man is reciprocally determined by God; he views himself as
passive; lie receives from God determinate revelations, determinate
proofs of his existence. Thus in revelation man determines himself as
that which determines God, <i>i.e.</i>, revelation is simply the
self-determination of man, only that between himself the determined,
and himself the determining, he interposes an object&mdash;God, a
distinct being. God is the medium by which man brings about the
reconciliation of himself with his own nature: God is the bond, the
<i>vinculum substantiale</i>, between the essential nature&mdash;the
species&mdash;and the individual.</p>
<p>The belief in revelation exhibits in the clearest manner the
characteristic illusion of the religious consciousness. The general
premiss of this belief is: man can of himself know nothing of God; all
his knowledge is merely vain, earthly, human. But God is a superhuman
being; God is known only by himself. Thus we know nothing of God beyond
what he reveals to us. The knowledge imparted by God is alone divine,
superhuman, supernatural knowledge. By means of revelation, therefore,
we know God through himself; for revelation is the word of
God&mdash;God declaring himself. Hence, in the belief in revelation man
makes himself a negation, he goes out of and above himself; he places
revelation in opposition to human knowledge and opinion; in it is
contained a hidden knowledge, the fulness of all supersensuous
mysteries; here reason must hold its peace. But nevertheless the divine
revelation is determined by the human nature. God speaks not to brutes
or angels, but to men; hence he uses human speech and human
conceptions. Man is an object to God, before God perceptibly imparts
himself to man; he thinks of man; he determines <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>his
action in accordance with the nature of man and his needs. God is
indeed free in will; he can reveal himself or not; but he is not free
as to the understanding; he cannot reveal to man whatever he will, but
only what is adapted to man, what is commensurate with his nature such
as it actually is; he reveals what he must reveal, if his revelation is
to be a revelation for man, and not for some other kind of being. Now
what God thinks in relation to man is determined by the idea of
man&mdash;it has arisen out of reflection on human nature. God puts
himself in the place of man, and thinks of himself as this other being
can and should think of him; he thinks of himself, not with his own
thinking power, but with man&rsquo;s. In the scheme of his revelation
God must have reference not to himself, but to man&rsquo;s power of
comprehension. That which comes from God to man, comes to man only from
<i>man in God</i>, that is, only from the ideal nature of man to the
phenomenal man, from the species to the individual. Thus, between the
divine revelation and the so-called human reason or nature, there is no
other than an illusory distinction;&mdash;the contents of the divine
revelation are of human origin, for they have proceeded not from God as
God, but from God as determined by human reason, human wants, that is,
directly from human reason and human wants. And so in revelation man
goes out of himself, in order, by a circuitous path, to return to
himself! Here we have a striking confirmation of the position that the
secret of theology is nothing else than anthropology&mdash;the
knowledge of God nothing else than a knowledge of man!</p>
<p>Indeed, the religious consciousness itself admits, in relation to
past times, the essentially human quality of revelation. The religious
consciousness of a later age is no longer satisfied with a Jehovah who
is from head to foot a man, and does not shrink from becoming visible
as such. It recognises that those were merely images in which God
accommodated himself to the comprehension of men in that age, that is,
merely human images. But it does not apply this mode of interpretation
to ideas accepted as revelation in the present age, because it is yet
itself steeped in those ideas. Nevertheless, every revelation is simply
a revelation of the nature of man to existing men. In revelation
man&rsquo;s latent nature is disclosed to him, because an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>object to him. He is determined, affected by his
own nature as by another being; he receives from the hands of God what
his own unrecognised nature entails upon him as a necessity, under
certain conditions of time and circumstance. Reason, the mind of the
species, operates on the subjective, uncultured man only under the
image of a personal being. Moral laws have force for him only as the
commandments of a Divine Will, which has at once the power to punish
and the glance which nothing escapes. That which his own nature, his
reason, his conscience says to him, does not bind him, because the
subjective, uncultured man sees in conscience, in reason, so far as he
recognises it as his own, no universal objective power; hence he must
separate from himself that which gives him moral laws, and place it in
opposition to himself, as a distinct personal being.</p>
<p>Belief in revelation is a childlike belief, and is only respectable
so long as it is childlike. But the child is determined from without,
and revelation has for its object to effect by God&rsquo;s help what
man cannot attain by himself. Hence revelation has been called the
education of the human race. This is correct; only revelation must not
be regarded as outside the nature of man. There is within him an inward
necessity which impels him to present moral and philosophical doctrines
in the form of narratives and fables, and an equal necessity to
represent that impulse as a revelation. The mythical poet has an end in
view&mdash;that of making men good and wise; he designedly adopts the
form of fable as the most appropriate and vivid method of
representation; but at the same time, he is himself urged to this mode
of teaching by his love of fable, by his inward impulse. So it is with
a revelation enunciated by an individual. This individual has an aim;
but at the same time he himself lives in the conceptions by means of
which he realises this aim. Man, by means of the imagination,
involuntarily contemplates his inner nature; he represents it as out of
himself. The nature of man, of the species&mdash;thus working on him
through the irresistible power of the imagination, and contemplated as
the law of his thought and action&mdash;is God.</p>
<p>Herein lie the beneficial moral effects of the belief in revelation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>But as Nature &ldquo;unconsciously produces results which look as if
they were produced consciously,&rdquo; so revelation generates moral
actions, which do not, however, proceed from morality;&mdash;moral
actions, but no moral dispositions. Moral rules are indeed observed,
but they are severed from the inward disposition, the heart, by being
represented as the commandments of an external lawgiver, by being
placed in the category of arbitrary laws, police regulations. What is
done is done not because it is good and right, but because it is
commanded by God. The inherent quality of the deed is indifferent;
whatever God commands is right.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4227src"
href="#xd21e4227" name="xd21e4227src">3</a> If these commands are in
accordance with reason, with ethics, it is well; but so far as the idea
of revelation is concerned, it is accidental. The ceremonial laws of
the Jews were revealed, divine, though in themselves adventitious and
arbitrary. The Jews received from Jehovah the command to
steal;&mdash;in a special case, it is true.</p>
<p>But the belief in revelation not only injures the moral sense and
taste,&mdash;the &aelig;sthetics of virtue; it poisons, nay it
destroys, the divinest feeling in man&mdash;the sense of truth, the
perception and sentiment of truth. The revelation of God is a
determinate revelation, given at a particular epoch: God revealed
himself once for all in the year so and so, and that, not to the
universal man, to the man of all times and places, to the reason, to
the species, but to certain limited individuals. A revelation in a
given time and place must be fixed in writing, that its blessings may
be transmitted uninjured. Hence the belief in revelation is, at least
for those of a subsequent age, belief in a written revelation; but the
necessary consequence of a faith in which an historical book,
necessarily subject to all the conditions of a temporal, finite
production, is regarded as an eternal, absolute, universally
authoritative word, is&mdash;superstition and sophistry.</p>
<p>Faith in a written revelation is a real, unfeigned, and so far
respectable faith, only where it is believed that all in the sacred
writings is significant, true, holy, divine. Where, on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>the
contrary, the distinction is made between the human and divine, the
relatively true and the absolutely true, the historical and the
permanent,&mdash;where it is not held that all without distinction is
unconditionally true; there the verdict of unbelief, that the Bible is
no divine book, is already introduced into the interpretation of the
Bible,&mdash;there, at least indirectly, that is, in a crafty,
dishonest way, its title to the character of a divine revelation is
denied. Unity, unconditionality, freedom from exceptions, immediate
certitude, is alone the character of divinity. A book that imposes on
me the necessity of discrimination, the necessity of criticism, in
order to separate the divine from the human, the permanent from the
temporary, is no longer a divine, certain, infallible book,&mdash;it is
degraded to the rank of profane books; for every profane book has the
same quality, that together with or in the human it contains the
divine, that is, together with or in the individual it contains the
universal and eternal. But that only is a truly divine book in which
there is not merely something good and something bad, something
permanent and something temporary, but in which all comes as it were
from one crucible, all is eternal, true and good. What sort of a
revelation is that in which I must first listen to the apostle Paul,
then to Peter, then to James, then to John, then to Matthew, then to
Mark, then to Luke, until at last I come to a passage where my soul,
athirst for God, can cry out: <span class="sc">Eureka</span>! here
speaks the Holy Spirit himself! here is something for me, something for
all times and men. How true, on the contrary, was the conception of the
old faith, when it extended inspiration to the very words, to the very
letters of Scripture! The word is not a matter of indifference in
relation to the thought; a definite thought can only be rendered by a
definite word. Another word, another letter&mdash;another sense. It is
true that such faith is superstition; but this superstition is alone
the true, undisguised, open faith, which is not ashamed of its
consequences. If God numbers the hairs on the head of a man, if no
sparrow falls to the ground without his will, how could he leave to the
stupidity and caprice of scribes his Word&mdash;that Word on which
depends the everlasting salvation of man? Why should he not dictate his
thoughts to their pen in order to guard them from the possibility of
disfiguration? &ldquo;But if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>man were a mere organ of the Holy
Spirit, human freedom would be abolished!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4250src" href="#xd21e4250" name="xd21e4250src">4</a> Oh, what a
pitiable argument! Is human freedom, then, of more value than divine
truth? Or does human freedom consist only in the distortion of divine
truth?</p>
<p>And just as necessarily as the belief in a determinate historical
revelation is associated with superstition, so necessarily is it
associated with sophistry. The Bible contradicts morality, contradicts
reason, contradicts itself, innumerable times; and yet it is the Word
of God, eternal truth, and &ldquo;truth cannot contradict
itself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4259src" href="#xd21e4259"
name="xd21e4259src">5</a> How does the believer in revelation elude
this contradiction between the idea in his own mind of revelation as
divine, harmonious truth, and this supposed actual revelation? Only by
self-deception, only by the silliest subterfuges, only by the most
miserable, transparent sophisms. Christian sophistry is the necessary
product of Christian faith, especially of faith in the Bible as a
divine revelation.</p>
<p>Truth, absolute truth, is given objectively in the Bible,
subjectively in faith; for towards that which God himself speaks I can
only be believing, resigned, receptive. Nothing is left to the
understanding, the reason, but a formal, subordinate office; it has a
false position, a position essentially contradictory to its nature. The
understanding in itself is here indifferent to truth, indifferent to
the distinction between the true and the false; it has no criterion in
itself; whatever is found in revelation is true, even when it is in
direct contradiction with reason. The understanding is helplessly given
over to the haphazard of the most ignoble empiricism;&mdash;whatever I
find in divine revelation I must believe, and if necessary, my
understanding must defend it; the understanding is the watchdog of
revelation; it must let everything without distinction be imposed on it
as truth,&mdash;discrimination would be doubt, would be a crime:
consequently, nothing remains to it but an adventitious, indifferent,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span><i>i.e.</i>, disingenuous, sophistical, tortuous
mode of thought, which is occupied only with groundless distinctions
and subterfuges, with ignominious tricks and evasions. But the more
man, by the progress of time, becomes estranged from revelation, the
more the understanding ripens into independence,&mdash;the more
glaring, necessarily, appears the contradiction between the
understanding and belief in revelation. The believer can then prove
revelation only by incurring contradiction with himself, with truth,
with the understanding, only by the most impudent assumptions, only by
shameless falsehoods, only by the sin against the Holy Ghost.

<h2 class="main">THE CONTRADICTION IN THE NATURE OF GOD IN
GENERAL.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The grand principle, the central point of Christian
sophistry, is the idea of God. God is the human being, and yet he must
be regarded as another, a superhuman being. God is universal, abstract
Being, simply the idea of Being; and yet he must be conceived as a
personal, individual being;&mdash;or God is a person, and yet he must
be regarded as God, as universal, <i>i.e.</i>, not as a personal being.
God is; his existence is certain, more certain than ours; he has an
existence distinct from us and from things in general, <i>i.e.</i>, an
individual existence; and yet his existence must be held a spiritual
one, <i>i.e.</i>, an existence not perceptible as a special one. One
half of the definition is always in contradiction with the other half:
the statement of what must be held always annihilates the statement of
what is. The fundamental idea is a contradiction which can be concealed
only by sophisms. A God who does not trouble himself about us, who does
not hear our prayers, who does not see us and love us, is no God; thus
humanity is made an essential predicate of God;&mdash;but at the same
time it is said: A God who does not exist in and by himself, out of
men, above men, as another being, is a phantom; and thus it is made an
essential predicate of God that he is non-human and extra-human. A God
who is not as we are, who has not consciousness, not intelligence,
<i>i.e.</i>, not a personal understanding, a personal consciousness
(as, for example, the &ldquo;substance&rdquo; of Spinoza), is no God.
Essential identity with us is the chief condition of deity; the idea of
deity is made dependent on the idea of personality, of consciousness,
<i lang="la">quo nihil majus cogitari potest</i>. But it is said in the
same breath, a God who is not essentially distinguished from us is no
God.</p>
<p>The essence of religion is the immediate, involuntary, unconscious
contemplation of the human nature as another, a distinct nature. But
when this projected image of human <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214"
href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>nature is made an object of
reflection, of theology, it becomes an inexhaustible mine of
falsehoods, illusions, contradictions, and sophisms.</p>
<p>A peculiarly characteristic artifice and pretext of Christian
sophistry is the doctrine of the unsearchableness, the
incomprehensibility of the divine nature. But, as will be shown, the
secret of this incomprehensibility is nothing further than that a known
quality is made into an unknown one, a natural quality into a
supernatural, <i>i.e.</i>, an unnatural one, so as to produce the
appearance, the illusion, that the divine nature is different from the
human, and is <i>eo ipso</i> an incomprehensible one.</p>
<p>In the original sense of religion, the incomprehensibility of God
has only the significance of an impassioned expression. Thus, when we
are affected by a surprising phenomenon, we exclaim: It is incredible,
it is beyond conception! though afterwards, when we recover our
self-possession, we find the object of our astonishment nothing less
than incomprehensible. In the truly religious sense,
incomprehensibility is not the dead full stop which reflection places
wherever understanding deserts it, but a pathetic note of exclamation
marking the impression which the imagination makes on the feelings. The
imagination is the original organ of religion. Between God and man, in
the primitive sense of religion, there is on the one hand only a
distinction in relation to existence, according to which God, as a
self-subsistent being, is the antithesis of man as a dependent being;
on the other hand, there is only a <i>quantitative</i> distinction,
<i>i.e.</i>, a distinction derived from the imagination, for the
distinctions of the imagination are only quantitative. The infinity of
God in religion is quantitative infinity; God is and has all that man
has, but in an infinitely greater measure. The nature of God is the
nature of the imagination unfolded, made objective.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4315src" href="#xd21e4315" name="xd21e4315src">1</a> God is a
being conceived under the forms of the senses, but freed from the
limits of sense,&mdash;a being at once unlimited and sensational. But
what is the imagination?&mdash;limitless activity of the senses. God is
eternal, <i>i.e.</i>, he exists at all times; God is omnipresent,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span><i>i.e.</i>, he exists in all places; God is the
omniscient being, <i>i.e.</i>, the being to whom every individual
thing, every sensible existence, is an object without distinction,
without limitation of time and place.</p>
<p>Eternity and omnipresence are sensational qualities, for in them
there is no negation of existence in time and space, but only of
exclusive limitation to a particular time, to a particular place. In
like manner omniscience is a sensational quality, a sensational
knowledge. Religion has no hesitation in attributing to God himself the
nobler senses: God sees and hears all things. But the divine
omniscience is a power of knowing through the senses while yet the
necessary quality, the essential determination of actual knowledge
through the senses is denied to it. My senses present sensible objects
to me only separately and in succession; but God sees all sensible
things at once, all locality in an unlocal manner, all temporal things
in an untemporal manner, all objects of sense in an unsensational
manner.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4342src" href="#xd21e4342" name=
"xd21e4342src">2</a> That is to say: I extend the horizon of my senses
by the imagination; I form to myself a confused conception of the whole
of things; and this conception, which exalts me above the limited
standpoint of the senses, and therefore affects me agreeably, I posit
as a divine reality. I feel the fact that my knowledge is tied to a
local standpoint, to sensational experience, as a limitation; what I
feel as a limitation I do away with in my imagination, which furnishes
free space for the play of my feelings. This negativing of limits by
the imagination is the positing of omniscience as a divine power and
reality. But at the same time there is only a <i>quantitative</i>
distinction between omniscience and my knowledge; the <i>quality</i> of
the knowledge is the same. In fact, it would be impossible for me to
predicate omniscience of an object or being external to myself, if this
omniscience were essentially different from my own knowledge, if it
were not a mode of perception of my own, if it had nothing in common
with my own power of cognition. That which is recognised by the senses
is as much the object and content of the divine omniscience as of my
knowledge. Imagination does away only with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>limit of quantity, not of quality. The
proposition that our knowledge is limited, means: we know only some
things, a few things, not all.</p>
<p>The beneficial influence of religion rests on this extension of the
sensational consciousness. In religion man is in the open air, <i>sub
deo</i>; in the sensational consciousness he is in his narrow confined
dwelling-house. Religion has relation essentially, originally&mdash;and
only in its origin is it something holy, true, pure, and good&mdash;to
the immediate sensational consciousness alone; it is the setting aside
of the limits of sense. Isolated, uninstructed men and nations preserve
religion in its original sense, because they themselves remain in that
mental state which is the source of religion. The more limited a
man&rsquo;s sphere of vision, the less he knows of history, Nature,
philosophy&mdash;the more ardently does he cling to his religion.</p>
<p>For this reason the religious man feels no need of culture. Why had
the Hebrews no art, no science, as the Greeks had? Because they felt no
need of it. To them this need was supplied by Jehovah. In the divine
omniscience man raises himself above the limits of his own
knowledge;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4360src" href="#xd21e4360" name=
"xd21e4360src">3</a> in the divine omnipresence, above the limits of
his local standpoint; in the divine eternity, above the limits of his
time. The religious man is happy in his imagination; he has all things
<i lang="la">in nuce</i>; his possessions are always portable. Jehovah
accompanies me everywhere; I need not travel out of myself; I have in
my God the sum of all treasures and precious things, of all that is
worth knowledge and remembrance. But culture is dependent on external
things; it has many and various wants, for it overcomes the limits of
sensational consciousness and life by real activity, not by the magical
power of the religious imagination. Hence the Christian religion also,
as has been often mentioned already, has in its essence no principle of
culture, for it triumphs over the limitations and difficulties of
earthly life only through the imagination, only in God, in heaven. God
is all that the heart needs and desires&mdash;all good things, all
blessings. &ldquo;Dost thou desire love, or faithfulness, or truth, or
consolation, or perpetual presence?&mdash;this is always in him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>without measure. Dost thou desire
beauty?&mdash;he is the supremely beautiful. Dost thou desire
riches?&mdash;all riches are in him. Dost thou desire power?&mdash;he
is supremely powerful. Or whatever thy heart desires, it is found a
thousandfold in Him, in the best, the single good, which is
God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4371src" href="#xd21e4371" name=
"xd21e4371src">4</a> But how can he who has all in God, who already
enjoys heavenly bliss in the imagination, experience that want, that
sense of poverty, which is the impulse to all culture? Culture has no
other object than to realise an earthly heaven; and the religious
heaven is only realised or won by religious activity.</p>
<p>The difference, however, between God and man, which is originally
only quantitative, is by reflection developed into a qualitative
difference; and thus what was originally only an emotional impression,
an immediate expression of admiration, of rapture, an influence of the
imagination on the feelings, has fixity given to it as an objective
quality, as real incomprehensibility. The favourite expression of
reflection in relation to this subject is, that we can indeed know
concerning God that he has such and such attributes, but not <i>how</i>
he has them. For example, that the predicate of the Creator essentially
belongs to God, that he created the world, and not out of matter
already existing, but out of nothing, by an act of almighty
power,&mdash;this is clear, certain&mdash;yes, indubitable; but how
this is possible naturally passes our understanding. That is to say:
the generic idea is clear, certain, but the specific idea is unclear,
uncertain.</p>
<p>The idea of activity, of making, of creation, is in itself a divine
idea; it is therefore unhesitatingly applied to God. In activity, man
feels himself free, unlimited, happy; in passivity, limited, oppressed,
unhappy. Activity is the positive sense of one&rsquo;s personality.
That is positive which in man is accompanied with joy; hence God is, as
we have already said, the idea of pure, unlimited joy. We succeed only
in what we do willingly; joyful effort conquers all things. But that is
joyful activity which is in accordance with our nature, which we do not
feel as a limitation, and consequently not as a constraint. And the
happiest, the most blissful activity is that which is productive. To
read is delightful, reading is passive activity; but to produce what is
worthy to be read is more delightful still. It is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>more
blessed to give than to receive. Hence this attribute of the
species&mdash;productive activity&mdash;is assigned to God; that is,
realised and made objective as divine activity. But every special
determination, every <i>mode</i> of activity is abstracted, and only
the fundamental determination, which, however, is essentially human,
namely, production of what is external to self, is retained. God has
not, like man, produced something in particular, this or that, but all
things; his activity is absolutely universal, unlimited. Hence it is
self-evident, it is a necessary consequence, that the mode in which God
has produced the All is incomprehensible, because this activity is no
<i>mode</i> of activity, because the question concerning the <i>how</i>
is here an absurdity, a question which is excluded by the fundamental
idea of unlimited activity. Every special activity produces its effects
in a special manner, because there the activity itself is a determinate
mode of activity; and thence necessarily arises the question: How did
it produce this? But the answer to the question: How did God make the
world? has necessarily a negative issue, because the world-creating
activity in itself negatives every determinate activity, such as would
alone warrant the question, every mode of activity connected with a
determinate medium, <i>i.e.</i>, with matter. This question
illegitimately foists in between the subject or producing activity, and
the object or thing produced, an irrelevant, nay, an excluded
intermediate idea, namely, the idea of particular, individual
existence. The activity in question has relation only to the
collective&mdash;the All, the world; God created all things, not some
particular thing; the indefinite whole, the All, as it is embraced by
the imagination,&mdash;not the determinate, the particular, as, in its
particularity, it presents itself to the senses, and as, in its
totality as the universe, it presents itself to the reason. Every
particular thing arises in a natural way; it is something determinate,
and as such it has&mdash;what it is only tautology to state&mdash;a
determinate cause. It was not God, but carbon that produced the
diamond; a given salt owes its origin, not to God, but to the
combination of a particular acid with a particular base. God only
created all things together without distinction.</p>
<p>It is true that according to the religious conception, God has
created every individual thing, as included in the whole;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>&mdash;but only indirectly; for he has not
produced the individual in an individual manner, the determinate in a
determinate manner; otherwise he would be a determinate or conditioned
being. It is certainly incomprehensible how out of this general,
indeterminate, or unconditioned activity the particular, the
determinate, can have proceeded; but it is so only because I here
intrude the object of sensational, natural experience, because I assign
to the divine activity another object than that which is proper to it.
Religion has no physical conception of the world; it has no interest in
a natural explanation, which can never be given but with a mode of
origin. Origin is a theoretical, natural-philosophical idea. The
heathen philosophers busied themselves with the origin of things. But
the Christian religious consciousness abhorred this idea as heathen,
irreligious, and substituted the practical or subjective idea of
creation, which is nothing else than a prohibition to conceive things
as having arisen in a natural way, an interdict on all physical
science. The religious consciousness connects the world immediately
with God; it derives all from God, because nothing is an object to him
in its particularity and reality, nothing is to him as it presents
itself to our reason. All proceeds from God:&mdash;that is enough, that
perfectly satisfies the religious consciousness. The question,
<i>how</i> did God create? is an indirect doubt that he <i>did</i>
create the world. It was this question which brought man to atheism,
materialism, naturalism. To him who asks it, the world is already an
object of theory, of physical science, <i>i.e.</i>, it is an object to
him in its reality, in its determinate constituents. It is this mode of
viewing the world which contradicts the idea of unconditioned,
immaterial activity: and this contradiction leads to the negation of
the fundamental idea&mdash;the creation.</p>
<p>The creation by omnipotence is in its place, is a truth, only when
all the phenomena of the world are derived from God. It becomes, as has
been already observed, a myth of past ages where physical science
introduces itself, where man makes the determinate causes, the
<i>how</i> of phenomena, the object of investigation. To the religious
consciousness, therefore, the creation is nothing incomprehensible,
<i>i.e.</i>, unsatisfying; at least it is so only in moments of
irreligiousness, of doubt, when the mind turns away from God to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>actual things; but it is highly unsatisfactory
to reflection, to theology, which looks with one eye at heaven and with
the other at earth. As the cause, so is the effect. A flute sends forth
the tones of a flute, not those of a bassoon or a trumpet. If thou
hearest the tones of a bassoon, but hast never before seen or heard any
wind-instrument but the flute, it will certainly be inconceivable to
thee how such tones can come out of a flute. Thus it is here:&mdash;the
comparison is only so far inappropriate as the flute itself is a
particular instrument. But imagine, if it be possible, an absolutely
universal instrument, which united in itself all instruments, without
being in itself a particular one; thou wilt then see that it is an
absurd contradiction to desire a particular tone which only belongs to
a particular instrument, from an instrument which thou hast divested
precisely of that which is characteristic in all particular
instruments.</p>
<p>But there also lies at the foundation of this dogma of
incomprehensibility the design of keeping the divine activity apart
from the human, of doing away with their similarity, or rather their
essential identity, so as to make the divine activity essentially
different from the human. This distinction between the divine and human
activity is &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; God makes,&mdash;he makes something
external to himself, as man does. Making is a genuine human idea.
Nature gives birth to, brings forth; man makes. Making is an act which
I can omit, a designed, premeditated, external act;&mdash;an act in
which my inmost being is not immediately concerned, in which, while
active, I am not at the same time passive, carried away by an internal
impulse. On the contrary, an activity which is identical with my being
is not indifferent, is necessary to me, as, for example, intellectual
production, which is an inward necessity to me, and for that reason
lays a deep hold on me, affects me pathologically. Intellectual works
are not made,&mdash;making is only the external activity applied to
them;&mdash;they arise in us. <i>To make</i> is an indifferent,
therefore a free, <i>i.e.</i>, optional activity. Thus far
then&mdash;that he makes&mdash;God is entirely at one with man, not at
all distinguished from him; but an especial emphasis is laid on this,
that his making is free, arbitrary, at his pleasure. &ldquo;It has
pleased God&rdquo; to create a world. Thus man here deifies
satisfaction in self-pleasing, in caprice and groundless arbitrariness.
The fundamentally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"
name="pb221">221</a>]</span>human character of the divine activity is
by the idea of arbitrariness degraded into a human manifestation of a
low kind; God, from a mirror of human nature, is converted into a
mirror of human vanity and self-complacency.</p>
<p>And now all at once the harmony is changed into discord; man,
hitherto at one with himself, becomes divided:&mdash;God makes <i>out
of nothing</i>; he creates,&mdash;to make out of nothing is to
create,&mdash;this is the distinction. The positive condition&mdash;the
act of making&mdash;is a human one; but inasmuch as all that is
determinate in this conception is immediately denied, reflection steps
in and makes the divine activity not human. But with this negation,
comprehension, understanding comes to a stand; there remains only a
negative, empty notion, because conceivability is already exhausted,
<i>i.e.</i>, the distinction between the divine and human determination
is in truth a nothing, a <i lang="la">nihil negativum</i> of the
understanding. The na&iuml;ve confession of this is made in the
supposition of &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; as an object.</p>
<p>God is Love, but not human love; Understanding, but not human
understanding,&mdash;no! an essentially different understanding. But
wherein consists this difference? I cannot conceive an understanding
which acts under other forms than those of our own understanding; I
cannot halve or quarter understanding so as to have several
understandings; I can only conceive one and the same understanding. It
is true that I can and even must conceive understanding in itself,
<i>i.e.</i>, free from the limits of my individuality; but in so doing
I only release it from limitations essentially foreign to it; I do not
set aside its essential determinations or forms. Religious reflection,
on the contrary, denies precisely that determination or quality which
makes a thing what it is. Only that in which the divine understanding
is identical with the human is something, is understanding, is a real
idea; while that which is supposed to make it another&mdash;yes,
essentially another than the human&mdash;is objectively nothing,
subjectively a mere chimera.</p>
<p>In all other definitions of the Divine Being the
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo; which constitutes the distinction is hidden; in
the creation, on the contrary, it is an evident, declared, objective
nothing;&mdash;and is therefore the official, notorious nothing of
theology in distinction from anthropology.</p>
<p>But the fundamental determination by which man makes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>his
own nature a foreign, incomprehensible nature is the idea of
individuality or&mdash;what is only a more abstract
expression&mdash;personality. The idea of the existence of God first
realises itself in the idea of revelation, and the idea of revelation
first realises itself in the idea of personality. God is a personal
being:&mdash;this is the spell which charms the ideal into the real,
the subjective into the objective. All predicates, all attributes of
the Divine Being are fundamentally human; but as attributes of a
personal being, and therefore of a being distinct from man and existing
independently, they appear immediately to be really other than human,
yet so as that at the same time the essential identity always remains
at the foundation. Hence reflection gives rise to the idea of so-called
anthropomorphisms. Anthropomorphisms are resemblances between God and
man. The attributes of the divine and of the human being are not indeed
the same, but they are analogous.</p>
<p>Thus personality is the antidote to pantheism; <i>i.e.</i>, by the
idea of personality religious reflection expels from its thought the
identity of the divine and human nature. The rude but characteristic
expression of pantheism is: Man is an effluence or a portion of the
Divine Being; the religious expression is: Man is the image of God, or
a being akin to God;&mdash;for according to religion man does not
spring from Nature, but is of divine race, of divine origin. But
kinship is a vague, evasive expression. There are degrees of kinship,
near and distant. What sort of kinship is intended? For the relation of
man to God there is but one form of kinship which is
appropriate,&mdash;the nearest, profoundest, most sacred that can be
conceived,&mdash;the relation of the child to the father. According to
this, God is the father of man, man the son, the child of God. Here is
posited at once the self-subsistence of God and the dependence of man,
and posited as an immediate object of feeling; whereas in pantheism the
part appears just as self-subsistent as the whole, since this is
represented as made up of its parts. Nevertheless this distinction is
only an appearance. The father is not a father without the child; both
together form a correlated being. In love man renounces his
independence, and reduces himself to a part; a self-humiliation which
is only compensated by the fact that the one whom he loves at the same
time voluntarily becomes a part also; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>that they both submit
to a higher power, the power of the spirit of family, the power of
love. Thus there is here the same relation between God and man as in
pantheism, save that in the one it is represented as a personal,
patriarchal relation, in the other as an impersonal, general
one,&mdash;save that pantheism expresses logically and therefore
definitely, directly, what religion invests with the imagination. The
correlation, or rather the identity of God and man is veiled in
religion by representing both as persons or individuals, and God as a
self-subsistent, independent being apart from his paternity:&mdash;an
independence which, however, is only apparent, for he who, like the God
of religion, is a father from the depths of the heart, has his very
life and being in his child.</p>
<p>The reciprocal and profound relation of dependence between God as
father and man as child cannot be shaken by the distinction that only
Christ is the true, natural son of God, and that men are but his
adopted sons; so that it is only to Christ as the only-begotten Son,
and by no means to men, that God stands in an essential relation of
dependence. For this distinction is only a theological, <i>i.e.</i>, an
illusory one. God adopts only men, not brutes. The ground of adoption
lies in the <i>human</i> nature. The man adopted by divine grace is
only the man conscious of his divine nature and dignity. Moreover, the
only-begotten Son himself is nothing else than the idea of humanity,
than man preoccupied with himself, man hiding from himself and the
world in God,&mdash;the heavenly man. The Logos is latent, tacit man;
man is the revealed, expressed Logos. The Logos is only the prelude of
man. That which applies to the Logos applies also to the nature of
man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4466src" href="#xd21e4466" name=
"xd21e4466src">5</a> But between God and the only-begotten Son there is
no real distinction,&mdash;he who knows the Son knows the Father
also,&mdash;and thus there is none between God and man.</p>
<p>It is the same with the idea that man is the image of God. The image
is here no dead, inanimate thing, but a living being. &ldquo;Man is the
image of God,&rdquo; means nothing more than that man is a being who
resembles God. Similarity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href=
"#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>between living beings rests on
natural relationship. The idea of man being the image of God reduces
itself therefore to kinship; man is like God, because he is the child
of God. Resemblance is only kinship presented to the senses; from the
former we infer the latter.</p>
<p>But resemblance is just as deceptive, illusory, evasive an idea as
kinship. It is only the idea of personality which does away with the
identity of nature. Resemblance is identity which will not admit itself
to be identity, which hides itself behind a dim medium, behind the
vapour of the imagination. If I disperse this vapour, I come to naked
identity. The more similar beings are, the less are they to to be
distinguished; if I know the one, I know the other. It is true that
resemblance has its degrees. But also the resemblance between God and
man has its degrees. The good, pious man is more like God than the man
whose resemblance to Him is founded only on the nature of man in
general. And even with the pious man there is a highest degree of
resemblance to be supposed, though this may not be obtained here below,
but only in the future life. But that which man is to become belongs
already to him, at least so far as possibility is concerned. The
highest degree of resemblance is that where there is no further
distinction between two individuals or beings than that they are two.
The essential qualities, those by which we distinguish things from each
other, are the same in both. Hence I cannot distinguish them in
thought, by the reason,&mdash;for this all data are wanting;&mdash;I
can only distinguish them by figuring them as visible in my imagination
or by actually seeing them. If my eyes do not say, There are really two
separately existent beings, my reason will take both for one and the
same being. Nay, even my eyes may confound the one with the other.
Things are capable of being confounded with each other which are
distinguishable by the sense and not by the reason, or rather which are
different only as to existence, not as to essence. Persons altogether
alike have an extraordinary attraction not only for each other, but for
the imagination. Resemblance gives occasion to all kinds of
mystifications and illusions, because it is itself only an illusion; my
eyes mock my reason, for which the idea of an independent existence is
always allied to the idea of a determinate difference. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span></p>
<p>Religion is the mind&rsquo;s light, the rays of which are broken by
the medium of the imagination and the feelings, so as to make the same
being appear a double one. Resemblance is to the Reason identity, which
in the realm of reality is divided or broken up by immediate
sensational impressions, in the sphere of religion by the illusions of
the imagination; in short, that which is identical to the reason is
made separate by the idea of individuality or personality. I can
discover no distinction between father and child, archetype and image,
God and man, if I do not introduce the idea of personality. Resemblance
is here the external guise of identity;&mdash;the identity which
reason, the sense of truth, affirms, but which the imagination denies;
the identity which allows an appearance of distinction to
remain,&mdash;a mere phantasm, which says neither directly yes, nor
directly no. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE CONTRADICTION IN THE SPECULATIVE DOCTRINE OF
GOD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The personality of God is thus the means by which man
converts the qualities of his own nature into the qualities of another
being,&mdash;of a being external to himself. The personality of God is
nothing else than the projected personality of man.</p>
<p>On this process of projecting self outwards rests also the Hegelian
speculative doctrine, according to which <i>man&rsquo;s</i>
consciousness of God is the <i>self</i>-consciousness of God. God is
thought, cognised by us. According to speculation, God, in being
thought by us, thinks himself or is conscious of himself; speculation
identifies the two sides which religion separates. In this it is far
deeper than religion, for the fact of God being thought is not like the
fact of an external object being thought. God is an inward, spiritual
being; thinking, consciousness, is an inward, spiritual act; to think
God is therefore to affirm what God is, to establish the being of God
as an act. That God is thought, cognised, is essential; that this tree
is thought, is to the tree accidental, unessential. God is an
indispensable thought, a necessity of thought. But how is it possible
that this necessity should simply express the subjective, and not the
objective also?&mdash;how is it possible that God&mdash;if he is to
exist for us, to be an object to us&mdash;must necessarily be thought,
if he is in himself like a block, indifferent whether he be thought,
cognised or not? No! it is not possible. We are necessitated to regard
the fact of God being thought by us, as his thinking himself, or his
self-consciousness.</p>
<p>Religious objectivism has two passives, two modes in which God is
thought. On the one hand, God is thought by us, on the other, he is
thought by himself. God thinks himself, independently of his being
thought by us: he has a self-consciousness distinct from, independent
of, our consciousness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href=
"#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>This is certainly consistent when
once God is conceived as a real personality; for the real human person
thinks himself, and is thought by another; my thinking of him is to him
an indifferent, external fact. This is the last degree of
anthropopathism. In order to make God free and independent of all that
is human, he is regarded as a formal, real person, his thinking is
confined within himself, and the fact of his being thought is excluded
from him, and is represented as occurring in another being. This
indifference or independence with respect to us, to our thought, is the
attestation of a self-subsistent, <i>i.e.</i>, external, personal
existence. It is true that religion also makes the fact of God being
thought into the self-thinking of God; but because this process goes
forward <i>behind</i> its consciousness, since God is immediately
presupposed as a self-existent personal being, the religious
consciousness only embraces the indifference of the two facts.</p>
<p>Even religion, however, does not abide by this indifference of the
two sides. God creates in order to reveal himself: creation is the
revelation of God. But for stones, plants, and animals there is no God,
but only for man; so that Nature exists for the sake of man, and man
purely for the sake of God. God glorifies himself in man: man is the
pride of God. God indeed knows himself even without man; but so long as
there is no other <i>me</i>, so long is he only a possible,
conceptional person. First when a difference from God, a non-divine is
posited, is God conscious of himself; first when he knows what is not
God, does he know what it is to be God, does he know the bliss of his
Godhead. First in the positing of what is other than himself, of the
world, does God posit himself as God. Is God almighty without creation?
No! Omnipotence first realises, proves itself in creation. What is a
power, a property, which does not exhibit, attest itself? What is a
force which affects nothing? a light that does not illuminate? a wisdom
which knows nothing, <i>i.e.</i>, nothing real? And what is
omnipotence, what all other divine attributes, if man does not exist?
Man is nothing without God; but also, God is nothing without
man;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4514src" href="#xd21e4514" name=
"xd21e4514src">1</a> for only in man is God an object as God;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>only in man is he God. The various qualities of
man first give difference, which is the ground of reality in God. The
physical qualities of man make God a physical being&mdash;God the
Father, who is the creator of Nature, <i>i.e.</i>, the personified,
anthropomorphised essence of Nature;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4532src" href="#xd21e4532" name="xd21e4532src">2</a> the
intellectual qualities of man make God an intellectual being, the
moral, a moral being. Human misery is the triumph of divine compassion;
sorrow for sin is the delight of the divine holiness. Life, fire,
emotion comes into God only through man. With the stubborn sinner God
is angry; over the repentant sinner he rejoices. Man is the revealed
God: in man the divine essence first realises and unfolds itself. In
the creation of Nature God goes out of himself, he has relation to what
is other than himself, but in man he returns into himself:&mdash;man
knows God, because in him God finds and knows himself, feels himself as
God. Where there is no pressure, no want, there is no
feeling;&mdash;and feeling is alone real knowledge. Who can know
compassion without having felt the want of it? justice without the
experience of injustice? happiness without the experience of distress?
Thou must feel what a thing is; otherwise thou wilt never learn to know
it. It is in man that the divine properties first become feelings,
<i>i.e.</i>, man is the self-feeling of God;&mdash;and the feeling of
God is the real God; for the qualities of God are indeed only real
qualities, realities, as felt by man,&mdash;as feelings. If the
experience of human misery were outside of God, in a being personally
separate from him, compassion also would not be in God, and we should
hence have again the Being destitute of qualities, or more correctly
the <i>nothing</i>, which God was before man or without man. For
example:&mdash;Whether I be a good or sympathetic being&mdash;for that
alone is good which gives, imparts itself, <i lang="la">bonum est
communicativum sui</i>,&mdash;is unknown to me before the opportunity
presents itself of showing goodness to another being. Only in the act
of imparting do I experience the happiness of beneficence, the joy of
generosity, of liberality. But is this joy apart <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>from
the joy of the recipient? No; I rejoice because he rejoices. I feel the
wretchedness of another, I suffer with him; in alleviating his
wretchedness, I alleviate my own;&mdash;sympathy with suffering is
itself suffering. The joyful feeling of the giver is only the reflex,
the self-consciousness of the joy in the receiver. Their joy is a
common feeling, which accordingly makes itself visible in the union of
hands, of lips. So it is here. Just as the feeling of human misery is
human, so the feeling of divine compassion is human. It is only a sense
of the poverty of finiteness that gives a sense of the bliss of
infiniteness. Where the one is not, the other is not. The two are
inseparable,&mdash;inseparable the feeling of God as God, and the
feeling of man as man, inseparable the knowledge of man and the
self-knowledge of God. God is a Self only in the human self,&mdash;only
in the human power of discrimination, in the principle of difference
that lies in the human being. Thus compassion is only felt as a
<i>me</i>, a self, a force, <i>i.e.</i>, as something special, through
its opposite. The opposite of God gives qualities to God, realises him,
makes him a Self. God is God, only through that which is not God.
Herein we have also the mystery of Jacob B&ouml;hme&rsquo;s doctrine.
It must only be borne in mind that Jacob B&ouml;hme, as a mystic and
theologian, places outside of man the feelings in which the divine
being first realises himself, passes from nothing to something, to a
qualitative being apart from the feelings of man (at least in
imagination),&mdash;and that he makes them objective in the form of
natural qualities, but in such a way that these qualities still only
represent the impressions made on his feelings. It will then be obvious
that what the empirical religious consciousness first posits with the
real creation of Nature and of man, the mystical consciousness places
before the creation in the premundane God, in doing which, however, it
does away with the reality of the creation. For if God has what is
not-God, already in himself, he has no need first to create what is
not-God in order to be God. The creation of the world is here a pure
superfluity, or rather an impossibility; this God for very reality does
not come to reality; he is already in himself the full and restless
world. This is especially true of Schelling&rsquo;s doctrine of God,
who though made up of innumerable &ldquo;potences&rdquo; is yet
thoroughly impotent. Far more reasonable, therefore, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>is
the empirical religious consciousness, which makes God reveal,
<i>i.e.</i>, realise himself in real man, real nature, and according to
which man is created purely for the praise and glory of God. That is to
say, man is the mouth of God, which articulates and accentuates the
divine qualities as human feelings. God wills that he be honoured,
praised. Why? because the passion of man for God is the
self-consciousness of God. Nevertheless, the religious consciousness
separates these two properly inseparable sides, since by means of the
idea of personality it makes God and man independent existences. Now
the Hegelian speculation identifies the two sides, but so as to leave
the old contradiction still at the foundation;&mdash;it is therefore
only the consistent carrying out, the completion of a religious truth.
The learned mob was so blind in its hatred towards Hegel as not to
perceive that his doctrine, at least in this relation, does not in fact
contradict religion;&mdash;that it contradicts it only in the same way
as, in general, a developed, consequent process of thought contradicts
an undeveloped, inconsequent, but nevertheless radically identical
conception.</p>
<p>But if it is only in human feelings and wants that the divine
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo; becomes something, obtains qualities, then the
being of man is alone the real being of God,&mdash;man is the real God.
And if in the consciousness which man has of God first arises the
self-consciousness of God, then the human consciousness is, <i>per
se</i>, the divine consciousness. Why then dost thou alienate
man&rsquo;s consciousness from him, and make it the self-consciousness
of a being distinct from man, of that which is an object to him? Why
dost thou vindicate existence to God, to man only the consciousness of
that existence? God has his consciousness in man, and man his being in
God? Man&rsquo;s knowledge of God is God&rsquo;s knowledge of himself?
What a divorcing and contradiction! The true statement is this:
man&rsquo;s knowledge of God is man&rsquo;s knowledge of himself, of
his own nature. Only the unity of being and consciousness is truth.
Where the consciousness of God is, there is the being of God,&mdash;in
man, therefore; in the being of God it is only thy own being which is
an object to thee, and what presents itself <i>before</i> thy
consciousness is simply what lies <i>behind</i> it. If the divine
qualities are human, the human qualities are divine.</p>
<p>Only when we abandon a philosophy of religion, or a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>theology, which is distinct from psychology and
anthropology, and recognise anthropology as itself theology, do we
attain to a true, self-satisfying identity of the divine and human
being, the identity of the human being with itself. In every theory of
the identity of the divine and human which is not true identity, unity
of the human nature with itself, there still lies at the foundation a
division, a separation into two, since the identity is immediately
abolished, or rather is supposed to be abolished. Every theory of this
kind is in contradiction with itself and with the
understanding,&mdash;is a half measure&mdash;a thing of the
imagination&mdash;a perversion, a distortion; which, however, the more
perverted and false it is, all the more <i>appears</i> to be profound.

<h2 class="main">THE CONTRADICTION IN THE TRINITY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Religion gives reality or objectivity not only to the
human or divine nature in general as a personal being; it further gives
reality to the fundamental determinations or fundamental distinctions
of that nature as persons. The Trinity is therefore originally nothing
else than the sum of the essential fundamental distinctions which man
perceives in the human nature. According as the mode of conceiving this
nature varies, so also the fundamental determinations on which the
Trinity is founded vary. But these distinctions, perceived in one and
the same human nature, are hypostasised as substances, as divine
persons. And herein, namely, that these different determinations are in
God, hypostases, subjects, is supposed to lie the distinction between
these determinations as they are in God, and as they exist in
man,&mdash;in accordance with the law already enunciated, that only in
the idea of personality does the human personality transfer and make
objective its own qualities. But the personality exists only in the
imagination; the fundamental determinations are therefore only for the
imagination hypostases, persons; for reason, for thought, they are mere
relations or determinations. The idea of the Trinity contains in itself
the contradiction of polytheism and monotheism, of imagination and
reason, of fiction and reality. Imagination gives the Trinity, reason
the Unity of the persons. According to reason, the things distinguished
are only distinctions; according to imagination, the distinctions are
things distinguished, which therefore do away with the unity of the
divine being. To the reason, the divine persons are phantoms, to the
imagination realities. The idea of the Trinity demands that man should
think the opposite of what he imagines, and imagine the opposite of
what he thinks,&mdash;that he should think phantoms realities.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4588src" href="#xd21e4588" name="xd21e4588src">1</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are three Persons, but they are not essentially distinguished.
<i lang="la">Tres person&aelig;</i>, but <i lang="la">una essentia</i>.
So far the conception is a natural one. We can conceive three and even
more persons, identical in essence. Thus we men are distinguished from
one another by personal differences, but in the main, in essence, in
humanity we are one. And this identification is made not only by the
speculative understanding, but even by feeling. A given individual is a
man as we are; <i>punctum satis</i>; in this feeling all distinctions
vanish,&mdash;whether he be rich or poor, clever or stupid, culpable or
innocent. The feeling of compassion, sympathy, is therefore a
substantial, essential, speculative feeling. But the three or more
human persons exist apart from each other, have a separate existence,
even when they verify and confirm the unity of their nature by fervent
love. They together constitute, through love, a single moral
personality, but each has a physical existence for himself. Though they
may be reciprocally absorbed in each other, may be unable to dispense
with each other, they have yet always a formally independent existence.
Independent existence, existence apart from others, is the essential
characteristic of a person, of a substance. It is otherwise in God, and
necessarily so; for while his personality is the same as that of man,
it is held to be the same with a difference, on the ground simply of
this postulate: there <i>must</i> be a difference. The three Persons in
God have no existence out of each other; else there would meet us in
the heaven of Christian dogmatics, not indeed many gods, as in Olympus,
but at least three divine Persons in an individual form, three Gods.
The gods of Olympus were real persons, for they existed apart from each
other, they had the criterion of real personality in their
individuality, though they were one in essence, in divinity; they had
different personal attributes, but were each singly a god, alike in
divinity, different as existing subjects or persons; they were genuine
divine personalities. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href=
"#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>The three Persons of the Christian
Godhead, on the contrary, are only imaginary, pretended persons,
assuredly different from real persons, just because they are only
phantasms, shadows of personalities, while, notwithstanding, they are
assumed to be real persons. The essential characteristic of personal
reality, the polytheistic element, is excluded, denied as non-divine.
But by this negation their personality becomes a mere phantasm. Only in
the truth of the plural lies the truth of the Persons. The three
persons of the Christian Godhead are not <i lang="la">tres Dii</i>,
three Gods;&mdash;at least they are not meant to be such;&mdash;but
<i lang="la">unus Deus</i>, one God. The three Persons end, not, as
might have been expected, in a plural, but in a singular; they are not
only <i>Unum</i>&mdash;the gods of Olympus are that&mdash;but
<i>Unus</i>. Unity has here the significance not of essence only, but
also of existence; unity is the existential form of God. Three are one:
the plural is a singular. God is a personal being consisting of three
persons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4623src" href="#xd21e4623" name=
"xd21e4623src">2</a></p>
<p>The three persons are thus only phantoms in the eyes of reason, for
the conditions or modes under which alone their personality could be
realised, are done away with by the command of monotheism. The unity
gives the lie to the personality; the self-subsistence of the persons
is annihilated in the self-subsistence of the unity&mdash;they are mere
relations. The Son is not without the Father, the Father not without
the Son: the Holy Spirit, who indeed spoils the symmetry, expresses
nothing but the relation of the two to each other. But the divine
persons are distinguished from each other only by that which
constitutes their relation to each other. The essential in the Father
as a person is that he is a Father, of the Son that he is a Son. What
the Father is over and above his fatherhood, does not belong to his
personality; therein he is God, and as God identical with the Son as
God. Therefore it is said: God the Father, God the Son, and God the
Holy Ghost:&mdash;God is in all three alike. &ldquo;There is one person
of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, is all one;&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, they are distinct
persons, but without distinction of substance. The personality,
therefore, arises purely in the relation of the Fatherhood;
<i>i.e.</i>, the idea of the person is here only a relative idea, the
idea of a relation. Man as a father is dependent, he is essentially the
correlative of the son; he is not a father without the son; by
fatherhood man reduces himself to a relative, dependent, impersonal
being. It is before all things necessary not to allow oneself to be
deceived by these relations as they exist in reality, in men. The human
father is, over and above his paternity, an independent personal being;
he has at least a formal existence for himself, an existence apart from
his son; he is not merely a father, with the exclusion of all the other
predicates of a real personal being. Fatherhood is a relation which the
bad man can make quite an external one, not touching his personal
being. But in God the Father, there is no distinction between God the
Father and God the Son <i>as God</i>; the abstract fatherhood alone
constitutes his personality, his distinction from the Son, whose
personality likewise is founded only on the abstract sonship.</p>
<p>But at the same time these relations, as has been said, are
maintained to be not mere relations, but real persons, beings,
substances. Thus the truth of the plural, the truth of polytheism is
again affirmed,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4658src" href="#xd21e4658"
name="xd21e4658src">3</a> and the truth of monotheism is denied. To
require the reality of the persons is to require the unreality of the
unity, and conversely, to require the reality of the unity is to
require the unreality of the persons. Thus in the holy mystery of the
Trinity,&mdash;that is to say, so far as it is supposed to represent a
truth distinct from human nature,&mdash;all resolves itself into
delusions, phantasms, contradictions, and sophisms.<a class="noteref"

curious to observe how the speculative religious philosophy undertakes
the defence of the Trinity against the godless understanding, and yet,
by doing away with the personal substances, and explaining the relation
of Father and Son as merely an inadequate image borrowed from organic
life, robs the Trinity of its very heart and soul. Truly, if the
cabalistic artifices which the speculative religious philosophy applies
in the service of the absolute religion were admissible in favour of
finite religions, it would not be difficult to squeeze the
Pandora&rsquo;s box of Christian dogmatics out of the horns of the
Egyptian Apis. Nothing further would be needed for this purpose than
the ominous distinction of the understanding from the speculative
reason,&mdash;a distinction which is adapted to the justification of
every absurdity.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main">THE CONTRADICTION IN THE SACRAMENTS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As the objective essence of religion, the idea of God,
resolves itself into mere contradictions, so also, on grounds easily
understood, does its subjective essence.</p>
<p>The subjective elements of religion are on the one hand Faith and
Love; on the other hand, so far as it presents itself externally in a
cultus, the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. The
sacrament of Faith is Baptism, the sacrament of Love is the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper. In strictness there are only two sacraments, as
there are two subjective elements in religion, Faith and Love: for Hope
is only faith in relation to the future; so that there is the same
logical impropriety in making it a distinct mental act as in making the
Holy Ghost a distinct being.</p>
<p>The identity of the sacraments with the specific essence of religion
as hitherto developed is at once made evident, apart from other
relations, by the fact that they have for their basis natural materials
or things, to which, however, is attributed a significance and effect
in contradiction with their nature. Thus the material of baptism is
water, common, natural water, just as the material of religion in
general is common, natural humanity. But as religion alienates our own
nature from us, and represents it as not ours, so the water of baptism
is regarded as quite other than common water; for it has not a physical
but a hyperphysical power and significance; it is the <i lang=
"la">Lavacrum regenerationis</i>, it purifies man from the stains of
original sin, expels the inborn devil, and reconciles with God. Thus it
is natural water only in appearance; in <i>truth</i> it is
supernatural. In other words: the baptismal water has supernatural
effects (and that which operates supernaturally is itself supernatural)
only in idea, only in the imagination.</p>
<p>And yet the material of Baptism is said to be natural water. Baptism
has no validity and efficacy if it is not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>performed with water.
Thus the natural quality of water has in itself value and significance,
since the supernatural effect of baptism is associated in a
supernatural manner with water only, and not with any other material.
God, by means of his omnipotence, could have united the same effect to
anything whatever. But he does not; he accommodates himself to natural
qualities; he chooses an element corresponding, analogous to his
operation. Thus the natural is not altogether set aside; on the
contrary, there always remains a certain analogy with the natural, an
appearance of naturalness. In like manner wine represents blood; bread,
flesh.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4693src" href="#xd21e4693" name=
"xd21e4693src">1</a> Even miracle is guided by analogies; water is
changed into wine or blood, one species into another, with the
retention of the indeterminate generic idea of liquidity. So it is
here. Water is the purest, clearest of liquids; in virtue of this its
natural character it is the image of the spotless nature of the Divine
Spirit. In short, water has a significance in itself, as water; it is
on account of its natural quality that it is consecrated and selected
as the vehicle of the Holy Spirit. So far there lies at the foundation
of Baptism a beautiful, profound natural significance. But, at the very
same time, this beautiful meaning is lost again because water has a
transcendental effect,&mdash;an effect which it has only through the
supernatural power of the Holy Spirit, and not through itself. The
natural quality becomes indifferent: he who makes wine out of water,
can at will unite the effects of baptismal water with any material
whatsoever.</p>
<p>Baptism cannot be understood without the idea of miracle. Baptism is
itself a miracle. The same power which works miracles, and by means of
them, as a proof of the divinity of Christ, turns Jews and Pagans into
Christians,&mdash;this same power has instituted baptism and operates
in it. Christianity began with miracles, and it carries itself forward
with miracles. If the miraculous power of baptism is denied, miracles
in general must be denied. The miracle-working water of baptism springs
from the same source as the water which at the wedding at Cana in
Galilee was turned into wine.</p>
<p>The faith which is produced by miracle is not dependent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>on
me, on my spontaneity, on freedom of judgment and conviction. A miracle
which happens before my eyes I must believe, if I am not utterly
obdurate. Miracle compels me to believe in the divinity of the
miracle-worker.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4702src" href="#xd21e4702"
name="xd21e4702src">2</a> It is true that in some cases it presupposes
faith, namely, where it appears in the light of a reward; but with that
exception it presupposes not so much actual faith as a believing
disposition, willingness, submission, in opposition to an unbelieving,
obdurate, and malignant disposition, like that of the Pharisees. The
end of miracle is to prove that the miracle-worker is really that which
he assumes to be. Faith based on miracle is the only thoroughly
warranted, well-grounded, objective faith. The faith which is
presupposed by miracle is only faith in a Messiah, a Christ in general;
but the faith that this very man is Christ&mdash;and this is the main
point&mdash;is first wrought by miracle as its consequence. This
presupposition even of an indeterminate faith is, however, by no means
necessary. Multitudes first became believers through miracles; thus
miracle was the cause of their faith. If then miracles do not
contradict Christianity,&mdash;and how should they contradict
it?&mdash;neither does the miraculous efficacy of baptism contradict
it. On the contrary, if baptism is to have a Christian significance it
must of necessity have a supernaturalistic one. Paul was converted by a
sudden miraculous appearance, when he was still full of hatred to the
Christians. Christianity took him by violence. It is in vain to allege
that with another than Paul this appearance would not have had the same
consequences, and that therefore the effect of it must still be
attributed to Paul. For if the same appearance had been vouchsafed to
others, they would assuredly have become as thoroughly Christian as
Paul. Is not divine grace omnipotent? The unbelief and
non-convertibility of the Pharisees is no counter-argument; for from
them grace was expressly withdrawn. The Messiah must necessarily,
according to a divine decree, be betrayed, maltreated and crucified.
For this purpose there must be individuals who should maltreat and
crucify him: and hence it was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239"
href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>prior necessity that the
divine grace should be withdrawn from those individuals. It was not
indeed totally withdrawn from them, but this was only in order to
aggravate their guilt, and by no means with the earnest will to convert
them. How would it be possible to resist the will of God, supposing of
course that it was his real will, not a mere velleity? Paul himself
represents his conversion as a work of divine grace thoroughly
unmerited on his part;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4719src" href=
"#xd21e4719" name="xd21e4719src">3</a> and quite correctly. Not to
resist divine grace, <i>i.e.</i>, to accept divine grace, to allow it
to work upon one, is already something good, and consequently is an
effect of the Holy Spirit. Nothing is more perverse than the attempt to
reconcile miracle with freedom of inquiry and thought, or grace with
freedom of will. In religion the nature of man is regarded as separate
from man. The activity, the grace of God is the projected spontaneity
of man, Free Will made objective.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4726src"
href="#xd21e4726" name="xd21e4726src">4</a></p>
<p>It is the most flagrant inconsequence to adduce the experience that
men are not sanctified, not converted by baptism, as an argument
against its miraculous efficacy, as is done by rationalistic orthodox
theologians;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4731src" href="#xd21e4731"
name="xd21e4731src">5</a> for all kinds of miracles, the objective
power of prayer, and in general all the supernatural truths of
religion, also contradict experience. He who appeals to experience
renounces faith. Where experience is a datum, there religious faith and
feeling have already vanished. The unbeliever denies the objective
efficacy of prayer only because it contradicts experience; the atheist
goes yet further,&mdash;he denies even the existence of God, because he
does not find it in experience. Inward experience creates no difficulty
to him; for what thou experiencest in thyself of another existence,
proves only that there is something in thee which thou thyself art not,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>which works upon thee independently of thy
personal will and consciousness, without thy knowing what this
mysterious something is. But faith is stronger than experience. The
facts which contradict faith do not disturb it; it is happy in itself;
it has eyes only for itself, to all else it is blind.</p>
<p>It is true that religion, even on the standpoint of its mystical
materialism, always requires the co-operation of subjectivity, and
therefore requires it in the sacraments; but herein is exhibited its
contradiction with itself. And this contradiction is particularly
glaring in the sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; for baptism is
given to infants,&mdash;though even in them, as a condition of its
efficacy, the co-operation of subjectivity is insisted on, but,
singularly enough, is supplied in the faith of others, in the faith of
the parents, or of their representatives, or of the church in
general.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4741src" href="#xd21e4741" name=
"xd21e4741src">6</a></p>
<p>The object in the sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is the body
of Christ,&mdash;a real body; but the necessary predicates of reality
are wanting to it. Here we have again, in an example presented to the
senses, what we have found in the nature of religion in general. The
object or subject in the religious syntax is always a real human or
natural subject or predicate; but the closer definition, the essential
predicate of this predicate is denied. The subject is sensuous, but the
predicate is not sensuous, <i>i.e.</i>, is contradictory to the
subject. I distinguish a real body from an imaginary one only by this,
that the former produces corporeal effects, involuntary effects, upon
me. If therefore the bread be the real body of God, the partaking of it
must produce in me immediate, involuntary sanctifying effects; I need
to make no special preparation, to bring with me no holy disposition.
If I eat an apple, the apple of itself gives rise to the taste of
apple. At the utmost I need nothing more than a healthy stomach to
perceive that the apple is an apple. The Catholics require a state of
fasting as a condition of partaking the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. This is
enough. I take hold of the body with my lips, I crush it with my
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>teeth, by my &oelig;sophagus it is carried into
my stomach; I assimilate it corporeally, not spiritually.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4754src" href="#xd21e4754" name="xd21e4754src">7</a>
Why are its effects not held to be corporeal? Why should not this body,
which is a corporeal, but at the same time heavenly, supernatural
substance, also bring forth in me corporeal and yet at the same time
holy, supernatural effects? If it is my disposition, my faith, which
alone makes the divine body a means of sanctification to me, which
transubstantiates the dry bread into pneumatic animal substance, why do
I still need an external object? It is I myself who give rise to the
effect of the body on me, and therefore to the reality of the body; I
am acted on by myself. Where is the objective truth and power? He who
partakes the Lord&rsquo;s Supper unworthily has nothing further than
the physical enjoyment of bread and wine. He who brings nothing, takes
nothing away. The specific difference of this bread from common natural
bread rests therefore only on the difference between the state of mind
at the table of the Lord, and the state of mind at any other table.
&ldquo;He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord&rsquo;s
body.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4766src" href="#xd21e4766"
name="xd21e4766src">8</a> But this mental state itself is dependent
only on the significance which I give to this bread. If it has for me
the significance not of bread, but of the body of Christ, then it has
not the effect of common bread. In the significance attached to it lies
its effect. I do not eat to satisfy hunger; hence I consume only a
small quantity. Thus to go no further than the quantity taken, which in
every other act of taking food plays an essential part, the
significance of common bread is externally set aside.</p>
<p>But this supernatural significance exists only in the imagination;
to the senses, the wine remains wine, the bread, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>bread. The Schoolmen therefore had recourse to
the precious distinction of substance and accidents. All the accidents
which constitute the nature of wine and bread are still there; only
that which is made up by these accidents, the subject, the substance,
is wanting, is changed into flesh and blood. But all the properties
together, whose combination forms this unity, are the substance itself.
What are wine and bread if I take from them the properties which make
them what they are? Nothing. Flesh and blood have therefore no
objective existence; otherwise they must be an object to the
unbelieving senses. On the contrary: the only valid witnesses of an
objective existence&mdash;taste, smell, touch, sight&mdash;testify
unanimously to the reality of the wine and bread, and nothing else. The
wine and bread are in reality natural, but in imagination divine
substances.</p>
<p>Faith is the power of the imagination, which makes the real unreal,
and the unreal real: in direct contradiction with the truth of the
senses, with the truth of reason. Faith denies what objective reason
affirms, and affirms what it denies.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4778src" href="#xd21e4778" name="xd21e4778src">9</a> The mystery
of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is the mystery of faith:<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4781src" href="#xd21e4781" name=
"xd21e4781src">10</a>&mdash;hence the partaking of it is the highest,
the most rapturous, blissful act of the believing soul. The negation of
objective truth which is not gratifying to feeling, the truth of
reality, of the objective world and reason,&mdash;a negation which
constitutes the essence of faith,&mdash;reaches its highest point in
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; for faith here denies an immediately present,
evident, indubitable object, maintaining that it is not what the reason
and senses declare it to be, that it is only in appearance bread, but
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>reality flesh. The position of the Schoolmen,
that according to the accidents it is bread, and according to the
substance flesh, is merely the abstract, explanatory, intellectual
expression of what faith accepts and declares, and has therefore no
other meaning than this: to the senses or to common perception it is
bread, but in truth, flesh. Where therefore the imaginative tendency of
faith has assumed such power over the senses and reason as to deny the
most evident sensible truths, it is no wonder if believers can raise
themselves to such a degree of exaltation as actually to see blood
instead of wine. Such examples Catholicism has to show. Little is
wanting in order to perceive externally what faith and imagination hold
to be real.</p>
<p>So long as faith in the mystery of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper as a
holy, nay the holiest, highest truth, governed man, so long was his
governing principle the imagination. All criteria of reality and
unreality, of unreason and reason, had disappeared: anything whatever
that could be imagined passed for real possibility. Religion hallowed
every contradiction of reason, of the nature of things. Do not ridicule
the absurd questions of the Schoolmen! They were necessary consequences
of faith. That which is only a matter of feeling had to be made a
matter of reason, that which contradicts the understanding had to be
made not to contradict it. This was the fundamental contradiction of
Scholasticism, whence all other contradictions followed of course.</p>
<p>And it is of no particular importance whether I believe the
Protestant or the Catholic doctrine of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. The
sole distinction is, that in Protestantism it is only on the tongue, in
the act of partaking, that flesh and blood are united in a thoroughly
miraculous manner with bread and wine;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4796src" href="#xd21e4796" name="xd21e4796src">11</a> while in
Catholicism, it is before the act of partaking, by the power of the
priest,&mdash;who however here acts only in the name of the
Almighty,&mdash;that bread and wine are really transmuted into flesh
and blood. The Protestant prudently avoids a definite explanation; he
does not lay himself open, like the pious, uncritical simplicity of
Catholicism, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>whose God, as an external object, can be
devoured by a mouse: he shuts up his God within himself, where he can
no more be torn from him, and thus secures him as well from the power
of accident as from that of ridicule; yet, notwithstanding this, he
just as much as the Catholic consumes real flesh and blood in the bread
and wine. Slight indeed was the difference at first between Protestants
and Catholics in the doctrine of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper! Thus at
Anspach there arose a controversy on the question&mdash;&ldquo;whether
the body of Christ enters the stomach, and is digested like other
food?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4804src" href="#xd21e4804"
name="xd21e4804src">12</a></p>
<p>But although the imaginative activity of faith makes the objective
existence the mere appearance, and the emotional, imaginary existence
the truth and reality; still, in itself or in truth, that which is
really objective is only the natural elements. Even the host in the pyx
of the Catholic priest is in itself only to faith a divine
body,&mdash;this external thing, into which he transubstantiates the
divine being, is only a thing of faith; for even here the body is not
visible, tangible, tasteable as a body. That is: the bread is only in
its significance flesh. It is true that to faith this significance has
the sense of actual existence;&mdash;as, in general, in the ecstasy of
fervid feeling that which signifies becomes the thing
signified;&mdash;it is held not to signify, but to <i>be</i> flesh. But
this state of being flesh is not that of real flesh; it is a state of
being which is only believed in, imagined, <i>i.e.</i>, it has only the
value, the quality, of a significance, a truth conveyed in a
symbol.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4815src" href="#xd21e4815" name=
"xd21e4815src">13</a> A thing which has a special significance for me,
is another thing in my imagination than in reality. The thing
signifying is not itself that which is signified. What it <i>is</i>, is
evident to the senses; what it <i>signifies</i>, is only in my
feelings, conception, imagination,&mdash;is only for me, not for
others, is not objectively present. So here. When therefore Zwinglius
said that the Lord&rsquo;s Supper has only a subjective significance,
he said the same thing as his opponents; only he disturbed the illusion
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>the religious imagination; for that which
&ldquo;is&rdquo; in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, is only an illusion of the
imagination, but with the further illusion that it is not an illusion.
Zwinglius only expressed simply, nakedly, prosaically,
rationalistically, and therefore offensively, what the others declared
mystically, indirectly,&mdash;inasmuch as they confessed<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4827src" href="#xd21e4827" name=
"xd21e4827src">14</a> that the effect of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
depends only on a worthy disposition or on faith; <i>i.e.</i>, that the
bread and wine are the flesh and blood of the Lord, are the Lord
himself, only for him for whom they have the supernatural significance
of the divine body, for on this alone depends the worthy disposition,
the religious emotion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4837src" href=
"#xd21e4837" name="xd21e4837src">15</a></p>
<p>But if the Lord&rsquo;s Supper effects nothing, consequently is
nothing,&mdash;for only that which produces effects,
<i>is</i>,&mdash;without a certain state of mind, without faith, then
in faith alone lies its reality; the entire event goes forward in the
feelings alone. If the idea that I here receive the real body of the
Saviour acts on the religious feelings, this idea itself arises from
the feelings; it produces devout sentiments, because it is itself a
devout idea. Thus here also the religious subject is acted on by
himself as if by another being, through the conception of an imaginary
object. Therefore the process of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper can quite
well, even without the intermediation of bread and wine, without any
church ceremony, be accomplished in the imagination. There are
innumerable devout poems, the sole theme of which is the blood of
Christ. In these we have a genuinely poetical celebration of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper. In the lively representation of the suffering,
bleeding Saviour, the soul identifies itself with him; here the saint
in poetic exaltation drinks the pure blood, unmixed with any
contradictory, material elements; here there is no disturbing object
between the idea of the blood and the blood itself.</p>
<p>But though the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, or a sacrament in general, is
nothing without a certain state of mind, without faith, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>nevertheless religion presents the sacrament at
the same time as something in itself real, external, distinct from the
human being, so that in the religious consciousness the true thing,
which is faith, is made only a collateral thing, a condition, and the
imaginary thing becomes the principal thing. And the necessary,
immanent consequences and effects of this religious materialism, of
this subordination of the human to the supposed divine, of the
subjective to the supposed objective, of truth to imagination, of
morality to religion,&mdash;the necessary consequences are superstition
and immorality: superstition, because a thing has attributed to it an
effect which does not lie in its nature, because a thing is held up as
<i>not</i> being what it in truth <i>is</i>, because a mere conception
passes for objective reality; immorality, because necessarily, in
feeling, the holiness of the action as such is separated from morality,
the partaking of the sacrament, even apart from the state of mind,
becomes a holy and saving act. Such, at least, is the result in
practice, which knows nothing of the sophistical distinctions of
theology. In general: <i>wherever religion places itself in
contradiction with reason, it places itself also in contradiction with
the moral sense</i>. Only with the sense of truth coexists the sense of
the right and good. Depravity of understanding is always depravity of
heart. He who deludes and cheats his understanding has not a veracious,
honourable heart; sophistry corrupts the whole man. And the doctrine of
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is sophistry.</p>
<p>The Truth of the disposition, or of faith as a requisite to
communion, involves the Untruth of the bodily presence of God; and
again the Truth of the objective existence of the divine body involves
the Untruth of the disposition. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247"

is greatly to the honour of Luther&rsquo;s understanding and sense of

unconditionally denied the free will of man as opposed to divine grace.
&ldquo;The name Free Will,&rdquo; says Luther, quite correctly from the

&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says Luther, &ldquo;is <i>in summa</i> our opinion,
that in and with the bread, the body of Christ is truly eaten; thus,
that all which the bread undergoes and effects, the body of Christ
undergoes and effects; that it is divided, eaten and chewed with the
teeth <i lang="la">propter unionem, sacramentalem</i>.&rdquo;
(Plank&rsquo;s Gesch. der Entst. des protest. Lehrbeg. B. viii. s.
369). Elsewhere, it is true, Luther denies that the body of Christ,
although it is partaken of corporeally, &ldquo;is chewed and digested
like a piece of beef.&rdquo; (Th. xix. p. 429.) No wonder; for that
which is partaken of is an object without objectivity, a body without
corporeality, flesh without the qualities of flesh; &ldquo;spiritual
flesh,&rdquo; as Luther says, <i>i.e.</i>, imaginary flesh. Be it
observed further, that the Protestants also take the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper fasting, but this is merely a custom with them, not a law. (See

so in another relation not developed here, but which may be mentioned
in a note: namely, the following. In religion, in faith, man is an
object to himself as the object, <i>i.e.</i>, the end or determining
motive, of God. Man is occupied with himself in and through God. God is
the means of human existence and happiness. This religious truth,
embodied in a cultus, in a sensuous form, is the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
In this sacrament man feeds upon God&mdash;the Creator of heaven and
earth&mdash;as on material food; by the act of eating and drinking he
declares God to be a mere means of life to man. Here man is virtually
supposed to be the <i>God</i> of God: hence the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is
the highest self-enjoyment of human subjectivity. Even the
Protestant&mdash;not indeed in words, but in truth&mdash;transforms God
into an external thing, since he subjects Him to himself as an object

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE CONTRADICTION OF FAITH AND LOVE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sacraments are a sensible presentation of that
contradiction of idealism and materialism, of subjectivism and
objectivism, which belongs to the inmost nature of religion. But the
sacraments are nothing without Faith and Love. Hence the contradiction
in the sacraments carries us back to the primary contradiction of Faith
and Love.</p>
<p>The essence of religion, its latent nature, is the <i>identity</i>
of the divine being with the human; but the form of religion, or its
apparent, conscious nature, is the <i>distinction</i> between them. God
is the human being; but he presents himself to the religious
consciousness as a distinct being. Now, that which reveals the basis,
the hidden essence of religion, is Love; that which constitutes its
conscious form is Faith. Love identifies man with God and God with man,
consequently it identifies man with man; faith separates God from man,
consequently it separates man from man, for God is nothing else than
the idea of the species invested with a mystical form,&mdash;the
separation of God from man is therefore the separation of man from man,
the unloosening of the social bond. By faith religion places itself in
contradiction with morality, with reason, with the unsophisticated
sense of truth in man; by love, it opposes itself again to this
contradiction. Faith isolates God, it makes him a particular, distinct
being: love universalises; it makes God a common being, the love of
whom is one with the love of man. Faith produces in man an inward
disunion, a disunion with himself, and by consequence an outward
disunion also; but love heals the wounds which are made by faith in the
heart of man. Faith makes belief in its God a law: love is
freedom,&mdash;it condemns not even the atheist, because it is itself
atheistic, itself denies, if not theoretically, at least practically,
the existence of a particular, individual God, opposed to man. Love has
God in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>itself: faith has God out of itself; it
estranges God from man, it makes him an external object.</p>
<p>Faith, being inherently external, proceeds even to the adoption of
outward fact as its object, and becomes historical faith. It is
therefore of the nature of faith that it can become a totally external
confession; and that with mere faith, as such, superstitious, magical
effects are associated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4881src" href=
"#xd21e4881" name="xd21e4881src">1</a> The devils believe that God is,
without ceasing to be devils. Hence a distinction has been made between
faith in God, and belief that there is a God.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4884src" href="#xd21e4884" name="xd21e4884src">2</a> But even
with this bare belief in the existence of God, the assimilating power
of love is intermingled;&mdash;a power which by no means lies in the
idea of faith as such, and in so far as it relates to external
things.</p>
<p>The only distinctions or judgments which are immanent to faith,
which spring out of itself, are the distinctions of right or genuine,
and wrong or false faith; or in general, of belief and unbelief. Faith
discriminates thus: This is true, that is false. And it claims truth to
itself alone. Faith has for its object a definite, specific truth,
which is necessarily united with negation. Faith is in its nature
exclusive. One thing alone is truth, one alone is God, one alone has
the monopoly of being the Son of God; all else is nothing, error,
delusion. Jehovah alone is the true God; all other gods are vain
idols.</p>
<p>Faith has in its mind something peculiar to itself; it rests on a
peculiar revelation of God; it has not come to its possessions in an
ordinary way, that way which stands open to all men alike. What stands
open to all is common, and for that reason cannot form a special object
of faith. That God is the creator, all men could know from Nature; but
what this God is in person, can be known only by special grace, is the
object of a special faith. And because he is only revealed in a
peculiar manner, the object of this faith is himself a peculiar being.
The God of the Christians is indeed the God of the heathens, but with a
wide difference:&mdash;just such a difference as there is between me as
I am to a friend, and me as I am to a stranger, who only knows me at a
distance. God as he is an object to the Christians, is quite another
than as he is an object to the heathens. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>The Christians know
God personally, face to face. The heathens know only&mdash;and even
this is too large an admission&mdash;&ldquo;what,&rdquo; and not
&ldquo;who,&rdquo; God is; for which reason they fell into idolatry.
The identity of the heathens and Christians before God is therefore
altogether vague; what the heathens have in common with the
Christians&mdash;if indeed we consent to be so liberal as to admit
anything in common between them&mdash;is not that which is specifically
Christian, not that which constitutes faith. In whatsoever the
Christians are Christians, therein they are distinguished from the
heathens;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4896src" href="#xd21e4896" name=
"xd21e4896src">3</a> and they are Christians in virtue of their special
knowledge of God; thus their mark of distinction is God. Speciality is
the salt which first gives a flavour to the common being. What a being
is in special, is the being itself; he alone knows me, who knows me
<i>in specie</i>. Thus the special God, God as he is an object to the
Christians, the personal God, is alone God. And this God is unknown to
heathens, and to unbelievers in general; he does not exist for them. He
is, indeed, said to exist for the heathens; but mediately, on condition
that they cease to be heathens, and become Christians. Faith makes man
partial and narrow; it deprives him of the freedom and ability to
estimate duly what is different from himself. Faith is imprisoned
within itself. It is true that the philosophical, or, in general, any
scientific theorist, also limits himself by a definite system. But
theoretic limitation, however fettered, short-sighted and
narrow-hearted it may be, has still a freer character than faith,
because the domain of theory is in itself a free one, because here the
ground of decision is the nature of things, argument, reason. But faith
refers the decision to conscience and interest, to the instinctive
desire of happiness; for its object is a special, personal Being,
urging himself on recognition, and making salvation dependent on that
recognition.</p>
<p>Faith gives man a peculiar sense of his own dignity and importance.
The believer finds himself distinguished above other men, exalted above
the natural man; he knows himself to be a person of distinction, in the
possession of peculiar privileges; believers are aristocrats,
unbelievers plebeians. God is this distinction and pre-eminence of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>believers above unbelievers,
personified.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4906src" href="#xd21e4906"
name="xd21e4906src">4</a> Because faith represents man&rsquo;s own
nature as that of another being, the believer does not contemplate his
dignity immediately in himself, but in this supposed distinct person.
The consciousness of his own pre-eminence presents itself as a
consciousness of this person; he has the sense of his own dignity in
this divine personality.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4912src" href=
"#xd21e4912" name="xd21e4912src">5</a> As the servant feels himself
honoured in the dignity of his master, nay, fancies himself greater
than a free, independent man of lower rank than his master, so it is
with the believer.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4918src" href=
"#xd21e4918" name="xd21e4918src">6</a> He denies all merit in himself,
merely that he may leave all merit to his Lord, because his own desire
of honour is satisfied in the honour of his Lord. Faith is arrogant,
but it is distinguished from natural arrogance in this, that it clothes
its feeling of superiority, its pride, in the idea of another person,
for whom the believer is an object of peculiar favour. This distinct
person, however, is simply his own hidden self, his personified,
contented desire of happiness: for he has no other qualities than
these, that he is the benefactor, the Redeemer, the
Saviour&mdash;qualities in which the believer has reference only to
himself, to his own eternal salvation. In fact, we have here the
characteristic principle of religion, that it changes that which is
naturally active into the passive. The heathen elevates himself, the
Christian feels himself elevated. The Christian converts into a matter
of feeling, of receptivity, what to the heathen is a matter of
spontaneity. The humility of the believer is an inverted
arrogance,&mdash;an arrogance none the less because it has not the
appearance, the external characteristics of arrogance. He feels himself
pre-eminent: this pre-eminence, however, is not a result of his
activity, but a matter of grace; he has been made pre-eminent; he can
do nothing towards it himself. He does not make himself the end of his
own activity, but the end, the object of God. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p>Faith is essentially determinate, specific. God according to the
specific view taken of him by faith, is alone the true God. This Jesus,
such as I conceive him, is the Christ, the true, sole prophet, the
only-begotten Son of God. And this particular conception thou must
believe, if thou wouldst not forfeit thy salvation. Faith is
imperative. It is therefore necessary&mdash;it lies in the nature of
faith&mdash;that it be fixed as dogma. Dogma only gives a formula to
what faith had already on its tongue or in its mind. That when once a
fundamental dogma is established, it gives rise to more special
questions, which must also be thrown into a dogmatic form, that hence
there results a burdensome multiplicity of dogmas,&mdash;this is
certainly a fatal consequence, but does not do away with the necessity
that faith should fix itself in dogmas, in order that every one may
know definitely what he must believe and how he can win salvation.</p>
<p>That which in the present day, even from the standpoint of believing
Christianity, is rejected, is compassionated as an aberration, as a
misinterpretation, or is even ridiculed, is purely a consequence of the
inmost nature of faith. Faith is essentially illiberal, prejudiced; for
it is concerned not only with individual salvation, but with the honour
of God. And just as we are solicitous as to whether we show due honour
to a superior in rank, so it is with faith. The apostle Paul is
absorbed in the glory, the honour, the merits of Christ. Dogmatic,
exclusive, scrupulous particularity, lies in the nature of faith. In
food and other matters, indifferent to faith, it is certainly liberal;
but by no means in relation to objects of faith. He who is not for
Christ is against him; that which is not christian is antichristian.
But what is christian? This must be absolutely determined, this cannot
be free. If the articles of faith are set down in books which proceed
from various authors, handed down in the form of incidental, mutually
contradictory, occasional dicta,&mdash;then dogmatic demarcation and
definition are even an external necessity. Christianity owes its
perpetuation to the dogmatic formulas of the Church.</p>
<p>It is only the believing unbelief of modern times which hides itself
behind the Bible, and opposes the biblical dicta to dogmatic
definitions, in order that it may set itself free from the limits of
dogma by arbitrary exegesis. But faith has already disappeared, is
become indifferent, when the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href=
"#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>determinate tenets of faith are
felt as limitations. It is only religious indifference under the
appearance of religion that makes the Bible, which in its nature and
origin is indefinite, a standard of faith, and under the pretext of
believing only the essential, retains nothing which deserves the name
of faith;&mdash;for example, substituting for the distinctly
characterised Son of God, held up by the Church, the vague negative
definition of a Sinless Man, who can claim to be the Son of God in a
sense applicable to no other being,&mdash;in a word, of a man, whom one
may not trust oneself to call either a man or a God. But that it is
merely indifference which makes a hiding-place for itself behind the
Bible, is evident from the fact that even what stands in the Bible, if
it contradicts the standpoint of the present day, is regarded as not
obligatory, or is even denied; nay, actions which are essentially
Christian, which are the logical consequences of faith, such as the
separation of believers from unbelievers, are now designated as
unchristian.</p>
<p>The Church was perfectly justified in adjudging damnation to
heretics and unbelievers,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4933src" href=
"#xd21e4933" name="xd21e4933src">7</a> for this condemnation is
involved in the nature of faith. Faith at first appears to be only an
unprejudiced separation of believers from unbelievers; but this
separation is a highly critical distinction. The believer has God for
him, the unbeliever, against him;&mdash;it is only as a possible
believer that the unbeliever has God not against him;&mdash;and therein
precisely lies the ground of the requirement that he should leave the
ranks of unbelief. But that which has God against it is worthless,
rejected, reprobate; for that which has God against it is itself
against God. To believe, is synonymous with goodness; not to believe,
with wickedness. Faith, narrow and prejudiced refers all unbelief to
the moral disposition. In its view the unbeliever is an enemy to Christ
out of obduracy, out of wickedness.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4936src"
href="#xd21e4936" name="xd21e4936src">8</a> Hence faith has fellowship
with believers only; unbelievers it rejects. It is well-disposed
towards believers, but ill-disposed towards unbelievers. <i>In faith
there lies a malignant principle.</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is owing to the egoism, the vanity, the self-complacency of
Christians, that they can see the motes in the faith of non-christian
nations, but cannot perceive the beam in their own. It is only in the
mode in which faith embodies itself that Christians differ from the
followers of other religions. The distinction is founded only on
climate or on natural temperament. A warlike or ardently sensuous
people will naturally attest its distinctive religious character by
deeds, by force of arms. But the nature of faith as such is everywhere
the same. It is essential to faith to condemn, to anathematise. All
blessings, all good it accumulates on itself, on its God, as the lover
on his beloved; all curses, all hardship and evil it casts on unbelief.
The believer is blessed, well-pleasing to God, a partaker of
everlasting felicity; the unbeliever is accursed, rejected of God and
abjured by men: for what God rejects man must not receive, must not
indulge;&mdash;that would be a criticism of the divine judgment. The
Turks exterminate unbelievers with fire and sword, the Christians with
the flames of hell. But the fires of the other world blaze forth into
this, to glare through the night of unbelief. As the believer already
here below anticipates the joys of heaven, so the flames of the abyss
must be seen to flash here as a foretaste of the awaiting
hell,&mdash;at least in the moments when faith attains its highest
enthusiasm.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4945src" href="#xd21e4945" name=
"xd21e4945src">9</a> It is true that Christianity ordains no
persecution of heretics, still less conversion by force of arms. But so
far as faith anathematises, it necessarily generates hostile
dispositions,&mdash;the dispositions out of which the persecution of
heretics arises. To love the man who does not believe in Christ, is a
sin against Christ, is to love the enemy of Christ,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4948src" href="#xd21e4948" name="xd21e4948src">10</a> That
which God, which Christ does not love, man must not love; his love
would be a contradiction of the divine will, consequently a sin. God,
it is true, loves all men; but only when and because they are
Christians, or at least may be and desire to be such. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>To
be a Christian is to be beloved by God; not to be a Christian is to be
hated by God, an object of the divine anger.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4953src" href="#xd21e4953" name="xd21e4953src">11</a> The
Christian must therefore love only Christians&mdash;others only as
possible Christians; he must only love what faith hallows and blesses.
Faith is the baptism of love. Love to man as man is only natural love.
Christian love is supernatural, glorified, sanctified love; therefore
it loves only what is Christian. The maxim, &ldquo;Love your
enemies,&rdquo; has reference only to personal enemies, not to public
enemies, the enemies of God, the enemies of faith, unbelievers. He who
loves the men whom Christ denies, does not believe Christ, denies his
Lord and God. Faith abolishes the natural ties of humanity; to
universal, natural unity, it substitutes a particular unity.</p>
<p>Let it not be objected to this, that it is said in the Bible,
&ldquo;Judge not, that ye be not judged;&rdquo; and that thus, as faith
leaves to God the judgment, so it leaves to him the sentence of
condemnation. This and other similar sayings have authority only as the
private law of Christians, not as their public law; belong only to
ethics, not to dogmatics. It is an indication of indifference to faith,
to introduce such sayings into the region of dogma. The distinction
between the unbeliever and the man is a fruit of modern philanthropy.
To faith, the man is merged in the believer; to it, the essential
difference between man and the brute rests only on religious belief.
Faith alone comprehends in itself all virtues which can make man
pleasing to God; and God is the absolute measure, his pleasure the
highest law: the believer is thus alone the legitimate, normal man, man
as he ought to be, man as he is recognised by God. Wherever we find
Christians making a distinction between the man and the believer, there
the human mind has already severed itself from faith; there man has
value in himself, independently of faith. Hence faith is true,
unfeigned, only where the specific difference of faith operates in all
its severity. If the edge of this difference is blunted, faith itself
naturally becomes indifferent, effete. Faith is liberal only in things
intrinsically indifferent. The liberalism of the apostle Paul
presupposes the acceptance of the fundamental articles of faith. Where
everything is made to depend on the fundamental <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>articles of faith, there arises the distinction
between essential and non-essential belief. In the sphere of the
non-essential there is no law,&mdash;there you are free. But obviously
it is only on condition of your leaving the rights of faith intact,
that faith allows you freedom.</p>
<p>It is therefore an altogether false defence to say, that faith
leaves judgment to God. It leaves to him only the moral judgment with
respect to faith, only the judgment as to its moral character, as to
whether the faith of Christians be feigned or genuine. So far as
classes are concerned, faith knows already whom God will place on the
right hand, and whom on the left; in relation to the persons who
compose the classes faith is uncertain; but that believers are heirs of
the Eternal Kingdom is beyond all doubt. Apart from this, however, the
God who distinguishes between believers and unbelievers, the condemning
and rewarding God, is nothing else than faith itself. What God
condemns, faith condemns, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Faith is a
consuming fire to its opposite.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4965src"
href="#xd21e4965" name="xd21e4965src">12</a> This fire of faith
regarded objectively, is the anger of God, or what is the same thing,
hell; for hell evidently has its foundation in the anger of God. But
this hell lies in faith itself, in its sentence of damnation. The
flames of hell are only the flashings of the exterminating, vindictive
glance which faith casts on unbelievers.</p>
<p>Thus faith is essentially a spirit of partisanship. He who is not
for Christ is against him.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4973src" href=
"#xd21e4973" name="xd21e4973src">13</a> Faith knows only friends or
enemies, it understands no neutrality; it is preoccupied only with
itself. Faith is essentially intolerant; essentially, because with
faith is always associated the illusion that its cause is the cause of
God, its honour his honour. The God of faith is nothing else than the
objective nature of faith&mdash;faith become an object to itself. Hence
in the religious consciousness also the cause of faith and the cause of
God are identified. God himself is interested: the interest of faith is
the nearest interest of God. &ldquo;He who toucheth you,&rdquo; says
the prophet Zachariah, &ldquo;toucheth the apple of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>His
eye.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4978src" href="#xd21e4978" name=
"xd21e4978src">14</a> That which wounds faith, wounds God, that which
denies faith, denies God himself.</p>
<p>Faith knows no other distinction than that between the service of
God and the service of idols. Faith alone gives honour to God; unbelief
withdraws from God that which is due to him. Unbelief is an injury to
God, religious high treason. The heathens worship demons; their gods
are devils. &ldquo;I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice,
they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye
should have fellowship with devils.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4983src" href="#xd21e4983" name="xd21e4983src">15</a> But the
devil is the negation of God; he hates God, wills that there should be
no God. Thus faith is blind to what there is of goodness and truth
lying at the foundation of heathen worship; it sees in everything which
does not do homage to its God, i.e., to itself, a worship of idols, and
in the worship of idols only the work of the devil. Faith must
therefore, even in feeling, be only negative towards this negation of
God: it is by inherent necessity intolerant towards its opposite, and
in general towards whatever does not thoroughly accord with itself.
Tolerance on its part would be intolerance towards God, who has the
right to unconditional, undivided sovereignty. Nothing ought to
subsist, nothing to exist, which does not acknowledge God, which does
not acknowledge faith:&mdash;&ldquo;That at the name of Jesus every
knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth, and things
under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
is Lord, to the glory of the Father.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4988src" href="#xd21e4988" name="xd21e4988src">16</a> Therefore
faith postulates a future, a world where faith has no longer an
opposite, or where at least this opposite exists only in order to
enhance the self-complacency of triumphant faith. Hell sweetens the
joys of happy believers. &ldquo;The elect will come forth to behold the
torments of the ungodly, and at this spectacle they will not be smitten
with sorrow; on the contrary, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257"
href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>while they see the
unspeakable sufferings of the ungodly, they, intoxicated with joy, will
thank God for their own salvation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4997src" href="#xd21e4997" name="xd21e4997src">17</a></p>
<p>Faith is the opposite of love. Love recognises virtue even in sin,
truth in error. It is only since the power of faith has been supplanted
by the power of the natural unity of mankind, the power of reason, of
humanity, that truth has been seen even in polytheism, in idolatry
generally,&mdash;or at least that there has been any attempt to explain
on positive grounds what faith, in its bigotry, derives only from the
devil. Hence love is reconcilable with reason alone, not with faith;
for as reason, so also love is free, universal, in its nature; whereas
faith is narrow-hearted, limited. Only where reason rules, does
universal love rule; reason is itself nothing else than universal love.
It was faith, not love, not reason, which invented Hell. To love, Hell
is a horror; to reason, an absurdity. It would be a pitiable mistake to
regard Hell as a mere aberration of faith, a false faith. Hell stands
already in the Bible. Faith is everywhere like itself; at least
positive religious faith, faith in the sense in which it is here taken,
and must be taken unless we would mix with it the elements of reason,
of culture,&mdash;a mixture which indeed renders the character of faith
unrecognisable.</p>
<p>Thus if faith does not contradict Christianity, neither do those
dispositions which result from faith, neither do the actions which
result from those dispositions. Faith condemns, anathematises; all the
actions, all the dispositions, which contradict love, humanity, reason,
accord with faith. All the horrors of Christian religious history,
which our believers aver not to be due to Christianity, have truly
arisen out of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>Christianity, because they have arisen out of
faith. This repudiation of them is indeed a necessary consequence of
faith; for faith claims for itself only what is good, everything bad it
casts on the shoulders of unbelief, or of misbelief, or of men in
general. But this very denial of faith that it is itself to blame for
the evil in Christianity, is a striking proof that it is really the
originator of that evil, because it is a proof of the narrowness,
partiality, and intolerance which render it well-disposed only to
itself, to its own adherents, but ill-disposed, unjust towards others.
According to faith, the good which Christians do, is not done by the
man, but by the Christian, by faith; but the evil which Christians do,
is not done by the Christian, but by the man. The evil which faith has
wrought in Christendom thus corresponds to the nature of
faith,&mdash;of faith as it is described in the oldest and most sacred
records of Christianity, of the Bible. &ldquo;If any man preach any

16</a>. The distinction between faith as it is expressed in the Bible
and faith as it has exhibited itself in later times, is only the
distinction between the bud and the plant. In the bud I cannot so
plainly see what is obvious in the matured plant; and yet the plant lay
already in the bud. But that which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>is obvious, sophists of
course will not condescend to recognise; they confine themselves to the
distinction between explicit and implicit existence,&mdash;wilfully
overlooking their essential identity.</p>
<p>Faith necessarily passes into hatred, hatred into persecution, where
the power of faith meets with no contradiction, where it does not find
itself in collision with a power foreign to faith, the power of love,
of humanity, of the sense of justice. Faith left to itself necessarily
exalts itself above the laws of natural morality. The doctrine of faith
is the doctrine of duty towards God,&mdash;the highest duty of faith.
By how much God is higher than man, by so much higher are duties to God
than duties towards man; and duties towards God necessarily come into
collision with common human duties. God is not only believed in,
conceived as the universal being, the Father of men, as
Love:&mdash;such faith is the faith of love;&mdash;he is also
represented as a personal being, a being by himself. And so far as God
is regarded as separate from man, as an individual being, so far are
duties to God separated from duties to man:&mdash;faith is, in the
religious sentiment, separated from morality, from love.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5101src" href="#xd21e5101" name=
"xd21e5101src">21</a> Let it not be replied that faith in God is faith
in love, in goodness itself; and that thus faith is itself an
expression of a morally good disposition. In the idea of personality,
ethical definitions vanish; they are only collateral things, mere
accidents. The chief thing is the subject, the divine <i>Ego</i>. Love
to God himself, since it is love to a personal being, is not a moral
but a personal love. Innumerable devout hymns breathe nothing but love
to the Lord; but in this love there appears no spark of an exalted
moral idea or disposition.</p>
<p>Faith is the highest to itself, because its object is a divine
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>personality. Hence it makes salvation dependent
on itself, not on the fulfilment of common human duties. But that which
has eternal salvation as its consequence, necessarily becomes in the
mind of man the chief thing. As therefore inwardly morality is
subordinate to faith, so it must also be outwardly, practically
subordinate, nay, sacrificed, to faith. It is inevitable that there
should be actions in which faith exhibits itself in distinction from
morality, or rather in contradiction with it;&mdash;actions which are
morally bad, but which according to faith are laudable, because they
have in view the advantage of faith. All salvation depends on faith: it
follows that all again depends on the salvation of faith. If faith is
endangered, eternal salvation and the honour of God are endangered.
Hence faith absolves from everything; for, strictly considered, it is
the sole subjective good in man, as God is the sole good and positive
being:&mdash;the highest commandment therefore is: Believe!<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5115src" href="#xd21e5115" name=
"xd21e5115src">22</a></p>
<p>For the very reason that there is no natural, inherent connection
between faith and the moral disposition, that, on the contrary, it lies
in the nature of faith that it is indifferent to moral duties,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5126src" href="#xd21e5126" name=
"xd21e5126src">23</a> that it sacrifices the love of man to the honour
of God,&mdash;for this reason it is required that faith should have
good works as its consequence, that it should prove itself by love.
Faith destitute of love, or indifferent to love, contradicts the
reason, the natural sense of right in man, moral feeling, on which love
immediately urges itself as a law. Hence faith, in contradiction with
its intrinsic character, has limits imposed on it by morality: a faith
which effects nothing good, which does not attest itself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>by
love, comes to be held as not a true and living faith. But this
limitation does not arise out of faith itself. It is the power of love,
a power independent of faith, which gives laws to it; for moral
character is here made the criterion of the genuineness of faith, the
truth of faith is made dependent on the truth of ethics:&mdash;a
relation which, however, is subversive of faith.</p>
<p>Faith does indeed make man happy; but thus much is certain: it
infuses into him no really moral dispositions. If it ameliorate man, if
it have moral dispositions as its consequence, this proceeds solely
from the inward conviction of the irreversible reality of
morals:&mdash;a conviction independent of religious faith. It is
morality alone, and by no means faith, that cries out in the conscience
of the believer: thy faith is nothing, if it does not make thee good.
It is not to be denied that the assurance of eternal salvation, the
forgiveness of sins, the sense of favour and release from all
punishment, inclines man to do good. The man who has this confidence
possesses all things; he is happy;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5153src"
href="#xd21e5153" name="xd21e5153src">24</a> he becomes indifferent to
the good things of this world; no envy, no avarice, no ambition, no
sensual desire, can enslave him; everything earthly vanishes in the
prospect of heavenly grace and eternal bliss. But in him good works do
not proceed from essentially virtuous dispositions. It is not love, not
the object of love, man, the basis of all morality, which is the motive
of his good works. No! he does good not for the sake of goodness
itself, not for the sake of man, but for the sake of God;&mdash;out of
gratitude to God, who has done all for him, and for whom therefore he
must on his side do all that lies in his power. He forsakes sin,
because it wounds God, his Saviour, his Benefactor.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5159src" href="#xd21e5159" name="xd21e5159src">25</a> The idea
of virtue is here the idea of compensatory sacrifice. God has
sacrificed himself for man; therefore man must sacrifice himself to
God. The greater the sacrifice the better the deed. The more anything
contradicts man and Nature, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=
"#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>the greater the abnegation, the
greater is the virtue. This merely negative idea of goodness has been
especially realised and developed by Catholicism. Its highest moral
idea is that of sacrifice; hence the high significance attached to the
denial of sexual love,&mdash;to virginity. Chastity, or rather
virginity, is the characteristic virtue of the Catholic
faith,&mdash;for this reason, that it has no basis in Nature. It is the
most fanatical, transcendental, fantastical virtue, the virtue of
supranaturalistic faith;&mdash;to faith, the highest virtue, but in
itself no virtue at all. Thus faith makes that a virtue which
intrinsically, substantially, is no virtue; it has therefore no sense
of virtue; it must necessarily depreciate true virtue because it so
exalts a merely apparent virtue, because it is guided by no idea but
that of the negation, the contradiction of human nature.</p>
<p>But although the deeds opposed to love which mark Christian
religious history, are in accordance with Christianity, and its
antagonists are therefore right in imputing to it the horrible actions
resulting from dogmatic creeds; those deeds nevertheless at the same
time contradict Christianity, because Christianity is not only a
religion of faith, but of love also,&mdash;pledges us not only to
faith, but to love. Uncharitable actions, hatred of heretics, at once
accord and clash with Christianity? how is that possible? Perfectly.
Christianity sanctions both the actions that spring out of love, and
the actions that spring from faith without love. If Christianity had
made love only its law, its adherents would be right,&mdash;the horrors
of Christian religious history could not be imputed to it; if it had
made faith only its law, the reproaches of its antagonists would be
unconditionally, unrestrictedly true. But Christianity has not made
love free; it has not raised itself to the height of accepting love as
absolute. And it has not given this freedom, nay, cannot give it,
because it is a religion,&mdash;and hence subjects love to the dominion
of faith. Love is only the exoteric, faith the esoteric doctrine of
Christianity; love is only the <i>morality</i>, faith the
<i>religion</i> of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>God is love. This is the sublimest dictum of Christianity. But the
contradiction of faith and love is contained in the very proposition.
Love is only a predicate, God the subject. What, then, is this subject
in distinction from love? And I must necessarily ask this question,
make this distinction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href=
"#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>The necessity of the distinction
would be done away with only if it were said conversely: Love is God,
love is the absolute being. Thus love would take the position of the
substance. In the proposition &ldquo;God is love,&rdquo; the subject is
the darkness in which faith shrouds itself; the predicate is the light,
which first illuminates the intrinsically dark subject. In the
predicate I affirm love, in the subject faith. Love does not alone fill
my soul: I leave a place open for my uncharitableness by thinking of
God as a subject in distinction from the predicate. It is therefore
inevitable that at one moment I lose the thought of love, at another
the thought of God, that at one moment I sacrifice the personality of
God to the divinity of love, at another the divinity of love to the
personality of God. The history of Christianity has given sufficient
proof of this contradiction. Catholicism, especially, has celebrated
Love as the essential deity with so much enthusiasm, that to it the
personality of God has been entirely lost in this love. But at the same
time it has sacrificed love to the majesty of faith. Faith clings to
the self-subsistence of God; love does away with it. &ldquo;God is
love,&rdquo; means, God is nothing by himself: he who loves, gives up
his egoistical independence; he makes what he loves indispensable,
essential to his existence. But while Self is being sunk in the depths
of love, the idea of the Person rises up again and disturbs the harmony
of the divine and human nature which had been established by love.
Faith advances with its pretensions, and allows only just so much to
Love as belongs to a predicate in the ordinary sense. It does not
permit love freely to unfold itself; it makes love the abstract, and
itself the concrete, the fact, the basis. The love of faith is only a
rhetorical figure, a poetical fiction of faith,&mdash;faith in ecstasy.
If faith comes to itself, Love is fled.</p>
<p>This theoretic contradiction must necessarily manifest itself
practically. Necessarily; for in Christianity love is tainted by faith,
it is not free, it is not apprehended truly. A love which is limited by
faith is an untrue love.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5181src" href=
"#xd21e5181" name="xd21e5181src">26</a> Love knows no law but itself;
it is divine through itself; it needs <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>not the sanction of
faith; it is its own basis. The love which is bound by faith is a
narrow-hearted, false love, contradicting the idea of love,
<i>i.e.</i>, self-contradictory,&mdash;a love which has only a
semblance of holiness, for it hides in itself the hatred that belongs
to faith; it is only benevolent so long as faith is not injured. Hence,
in this contradiction with itself, in order to retain the semblance of
love, it falls into the most diabolical sophisms, as we see in
Augustine&rsquo;s apology for the persecution of heretics. Love is
limited by faith; hence it does not regard even the uncharitable
actions which faith suggests as in contradiction with itself; it
interprets the deeds of hatred which are committed for the sake of
faith as deeds of love. And it necessarily falls into such
contradictions, because the limitation of love by faith is itself a
contradiction. If it once is subjected to this limitation, it has given
up its own judgment, its inherent measure and criterion, its
self-subsistence; it is delivered up without power of resistance to the
promptings of faith.</p>
<p>Here we have again an example, that much which is not found in the
letter of the Bible, is nevertheless there in principle. We find the
same contradictions in the Bible as in Augustine, as in Catholicism
generally; only that in the latter they are definitely declared, they
are developed into a conspicuous, and therefore revolting existence.
The Bible curses through faith, blesses through love. But the only love
it knows is a love founded on faith. Thus here already it is a love
which curses, an unreliable love, a love which gives me no guarantee
that it will not turn into hatred; for if I do not acknowledge the
articles of faith, I am out of the sphere of love, a child of hell, an
object of anathema, of the anger of God, to whom the existence of
unbelievers is a vexation, a thorn in the eye. Christian love has not
overcome hell, because it has not overcome faith. Love is in itself
unbelieving, faith unloving. And love is unbelieving because it knows
nothing more divine than itself, because it believes only in itself as
absolute truth.</p>
<p>Christian love is already signalised as a particular, limited love,
by the very epithet, Christian. But love is in its nature universal. So
long as Christian love does not renounce its qualification of
Christian, does not make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>love, simply, its highest law, so
long is it a love which is injurious to the sense of truth, for the
very office of love is to abolish the distinction between Christianity
and so-called heathenism;&mdash;so long is it a love which by its
particularity is in contradiction with the nature of love, an abnormal,
loveless love, which has therefore long been justly an object of
sarcasm. True love is sufficient to itself; it needs no special title,
no authority. Love is the universal law of intelligence and
Nature;&mdash;it is nothing else than the realisation of the unity of
the species through the medium of moral sentiment. To found this love
on the name of a person, is only possible by the association of
superstitious ideas, either of a religious or speculative character.
For with superstition is always associated particularism, and with
particularism, fanaticism. Love can only be founded on the unity of the
species, the unity of intelligence&mdash;on the nature of mankind; then
only is it a well-grounded love, safe in its principle, guaranteed,
free, for it is fed by the original source of love, out of which the
love of Christ himself arose. The love of Christ was itself a derived
love. He loved us not out of himself, by virtue of his own authority,
but by virtue of our common human nature. A love which is based on his
person is a particular, exclusive love, which extends only so far as
the acknowledgment of this person extends, a love which does not rest
on the proper ground of love. Are we to love each other because Christ
loved us? Such love would be an affected, imitative love. Can we truly
love each other only if we love Christ? Is Christ the cause of love? Is
he not rather the apostle of love? Is not the ground of his love the
unity of human nature? Shall I love Christ more than mankind? Is not
such love a chimerical love? Can I step beyond the idea of the species?
Can I love anything higher than humanity? What ennobled Christ was
love; whatever qualities he had, he held in fealty to love; he was not
the proprietor of love, as he is represented to be in all superstitious
conceptions. The idea of love is an independent idea; I do not first
deduce it from the life of Christ; on the contrary, I revere that life
only because I find it accordant with the law, the idea of love.</p>
<p>This is already proved historically by the fact that the idea of
love was by no means first introduced into the consciousness
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>of mankind with and by Christianity,&mdash;is by
no means peculiarly Christian. The horrors of the Roman Empire present
themselves with striking significance in company with the appearance of
this idea. The empire of policy which united men after a manner
corresponding with its own idea, was coming to its necessary end.
Political unity is a unity of force. The despotism of Rome must turn in
upon itself, destroy itself. But it was precisely through this
catastrophe of political existence that man released himself entirely
from the heart-stifling toils of politics. In the place of Rome
appeared the idea of humanity; to the idea of dominion succeeded the
idea of love. Even the Jews, by imbibing the principle of humanity
contained in Greek culture, had by this time mollified their malignant
religious separatism. Philo celebrates love as the highest virtue. The
extinction of national differences lay in the idea of humanity itself.
Thinking minds had very early overstepped the civil and political
separation of man from man. Aristotle distinguishes the man from the
slave, and places the slave, as a man, on a level with his master,
uniting them in friendship. Epictetus, the slave, was a Stoic;
Antoninus, the emperor, was a Stoic also: thus did philosophy unite
men. The Stoics taught<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5199src" href=
"#xd21e5199" name="xd21e5199src">27</a> that man was not born for his
own sake, but for the sake of others, <i>i.e.</i>, for love: a
principle which implies infinitely more than the celebrated dictum of
the Emperor Antoninus, which enjoined the love of enemies. The
practical principle of the Stoics is so far the principle of love. The
world is to them one city, men its citizens. Seneca, in the sublimest
sayings, extols love, clemency, humanity, especially towards slaves.
Thus political rigour and patriotic narrowness were on the wane.</p>
<p>Christianity was a peculiar manifestation of these human
tendencies;&mdash;a popular, consequently a religious, and certainly a
most intense manifestation of this new principle of love. That which
elsewhere made itself apparent in the process of culture, expressed
itself here as religious feeling, as a matter of faith. Christianity
thus reduced a general unity to a particular one, it made love
collateral to faith; and by this means it placed itself in
contradiction with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268"
name="pb268">268</a>]</span>universal love. The unity was not referred
to its true origin. National differences indeed disappeared; but in
their place difference of faith, the opposition of Christian and
un-Christian, more vehement than a national antagonism, and also more
malignant, made its appearance in history.</p>
<p>All love founded on a special historical phenomenon contradicts, as
has been said, the nature of love, which endures no limits, which
triumphs over all particularity. Man is to be loved for man&rsquo;s
sake. Man is an object of love because he is an end in himself, because
he is a rational and loving being. This is the law of the species, the
law of the intelligence. Love should be immediate, undetermined by
anything else than its object;&mdash;nay, only as such is it love. But
if I interpose between my fellow-man and myself the idea of an
individuality, in whom the idea of the species is supposed to be
already realised, I annihilate the very soul of love, I disturb the
unity by the idea of a third external to us; for in that case my
fellow-man is an object of love to me only on account of his
resemblance or relation to this model, not for his own sake. Here all
the contradictions reappear which we have in the personality of God,
where the idea of the personality by itself, without regard to the
qualities which render it worthy of love and reverence, fixes itself in
the consciousness and feelings. Love is the subjective reality of the
species, as reason is its objective reality. In love, in reason, the
need of an intermediate person disappears. Christ is nothing but an
image, under which the unity of the species has impressed itself on the
popular consciousness. Christ loved men: he wished to bless and unite
them all without distinction of sex, age, rank, or nationality. Christ
is the love of mankind to itself embodied in an image&mdash;in
accordance with the nature of religion as we have developed it&mdash;or
contemplated as a person, but a person who (we mean, of course, as a
religious object) has only the significance of an image, who is only
ideal. For this reason love is pronounced to be the characteristic mark
of the disciples. But love, as has been said, is nothing else than the
active proof, the realisation of the unity of the race, through the
medium of the moral disposition. The species is not an abstraction; it
exists in feeling, in the moral sentiment, in the energy of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>love. It is the species which infuses love into
me. A loving heart is the heart of the species throbbing in the
individual. Thus Christ, as the consciousness of love, is the
consciousness of the species. We are all one in Christ. Christ is the
consciousness of our identity. He therefore who loves man for the sake
of man, who rises to the love of the species, to universal love,
adequate to the nature of the species,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5213src" href="#xd21e5213" name="xd21e5213src">28</a> he is a
Christian, is Christ himself. He does what Christ did, what made Christ
Christ. Thus, where there arises the consciousness of the species as a
species, the idea of humanity as a whole, Christ disappears, without,
however, his true nature disappearing; for he was the substitute for
the consciousness of the species, the image under which it was made
present to the people, and became the law of the popular life.

L. 1. iv. dist. 50, c.4. But this passage is by no means a declaration
of Peter Lombard himself. He is far too modest, timid, and dependent on
the authorities of Christianity to have ventured to advance such a
tenet on his own account. No! This position is a universal declaration,
a characteristic expression of Christian, of believing love. The
doctrine of some Fathers of the Church, <i>e.g.</i>, of Origen and
Gregory of Nyssa, that the punishment of the damned would have an end,
sprung not out of Christian or Church doctrine, but out of Platonism.
Hence the doctrine that the punishment of hell is finite, was rejected
not only by the Catholic but also by the Protestant church. (Augsb.
Confess. art. 17). A precious example of the exclusive, misanthropical
narrowness of Christian love, is the passage cited from Buddeus by
Strauss (<span lang="de">Christl. Glaubensl. B. ii. s. 547</span>),
according to which not infants in general, but those of Christians
exclusively, would have a share in the divine grace and blessings if
they died unbaptized.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the contradiction between Faith and Love which has
just been exhibited, we see the practical, palpable ground of necessity
that we should raise ourselves above Christianity, above the peculiar
stand-point of all religion. We have shown that the substance and
object of religion is altogether human; we have shown that divine
wisdom is human wisdom; that the secret of theology is anthropology;
that the absolute mind is the so-called finite subjective mind. But
religion is not conscious that its elements are human; on the contrary,
it places itself in opposition to the human, or at least it does not
admit that its elements are human. The necessary turning-point of
history is therefore the open confession, that the consciousness of God
is nothing else than the consciousness of the species; that man can and
should raise himself only above the limits of his individuality, and
not above the laws, the positive essential conditions of his species;
that there is no other essence which man can think, dream of, imagine,
feel, believe in, wish for, love and adore as the <i>absolute</i>, than
the essence of human nature itself.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5231src"
href="#xd21e5231" name="xd21e5231src">1</a></p>
<p>Our relation to religion is therefore not a merely negative, but a
critical one; we only separate the true from the false;&mdash;though we
grant that the truth thus separated from falsehood is a new truth,
essentially different from the old. Religion is the first form of
self-consciousness. Religions are sacred because they are the
traditions of the primitive self-consciousness. But that which in
religion holds the first place&mdash;namely, God&mdash;is, as we have
shown, in itself and according to truth, the second, for it is only the
nature of man regarded objectively; and that which to religion is the
second&mdash;namely, man&mdash;must therefore be constituted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>and declared the first. Love to man must be no
derivative love; it must be original. If human nature is the highest
nature to man, then practically also the highest and first law must be
the love of man to man. <i>Homo homini Deus est</i>:&mdash;this is the
great practical principle:&mdash;this is the axis on which revolves the
history of the world. The relations of child and parent, of husband and
wife, of brother and friend&mdash;in general, of man to man&mdash;in
short, all the moral relations are <i>per se</i> religious. Life as a
whole is, in its essential, substantial relations, throughout of a
divine nature. Its religious consecration is not first conferred by the
blessing of the priest. But the pretension of religion is that it can
hallow an object by its essentially external co-operation; it thereby
assumes to be itself the only holy power; besides itself it knows only
earthly, ungodly relations; hence it comes forward in order to
consecrate them and make them holy.</p>
<p>But marriage&mdash;we mean, of course, marriage as the free bond of
love<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5246src" href="#xd21e5246" name=
"xd21e5246src">2</a>&mdash;is sacred in itself, by the very nature of
the union which is therein effected. That alone is a religious
marriage, which is a true marriage, which corresponds to the essence of
marriage&mdash;of love. And so it is with all moral relations. Then
only are they moral,&mdash;then only are they enjoyed in a moral
spirit, when they are regarded as sacred in themselves. True friendship
exists only when the boundaries of friendship are preserved with
religious conscientiousness, with the same conscientiousness with which
the believer watches over the dignity of his God. Let friendship be
sacred to thee, property sacred, marriage sacred,&mdash;sacred the
well-being of every man; but let them be sacred <i>in and by
themselves</i>.</p>
<p>In Christianity the moral laws are regarded as the commandments of
God; morality is even made the criterion of piety; but ethics have
nevertheless a subordinate rank, they have not in themselves a
religious significance. This belongs only to faith. Above morality
hovers God, as a being distinct from man, a being to whom the best is
due, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>while the remnants only fall to the share of
man. All those dispositions which ought to be devoted to life, to
man&mdash;all the best powers of humanity, are lavished on the being
who wants nothing. The real cause is converted into an impersonal
means, a merely conceptional, imaginary cause usurps the place of the
true one. Man thanks God for those benefits which have been rendered to
him even at the cost of sacrifice by his fellow-man. The gratitude
which he expresses to his benefactor is only ostensible; it is paid,
not to him, but to God. He is thankful, grateful to God, but unthankful
to man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5256src" href="#xd21e5256" name=
"xd21e5256src">3</a> Thus is the moral sentiment subverted into
religion! Thus does man sacrifice man to God! The bloody human
sacrifice is in fact only a rude, material expression of the inmost
secret of religion. Where bloody human sacrifices are offered to God,
such sacrifices are regarded as the highest thing, physical existence
as the chief good. For this reason life is sacrificed to God, and it is
so on extraordinary occasions; the supposition being that this is the
way to show him the greatest honour. If Christianity no longer, at
least in our day, offers bloody sacrifices to its God, this arises, to
say nothing of other reasons, from the fact that physical existence is
no longer regarded as the highest good. Hence the soul, the emotions
are now offered to God, because these are held to be something higher.
But the common case is, that in religion man sacrifices some duty
towards man&mdash;such as that of respecting the life of his fellow, of
being grateful to him&mdash;to a religious obligation,&mdash;sacrifices
his relation to man to his relation to God. The Christians, by the idea
that God is without wants, and that he is only an object of pure
adoration, have certainly done away with many pernicious conceptions.
But this freedom from wants is only a metaphysical idea, which is by no
means part of the peculiar nature of religion. When the need for
worship is supposed to exist only on one side, the subjective side,
this has the invariable effect of one-sidedness, and leaves the
religious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>emotions cold; hence, if not in express words,
yet in fact, there must be attributed to God a condition corresponding
to the subjective need, the need of the worshipper, in order to
establish reciprocity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5261src" href=
"#xd21e5261" name="xd21e5261src">4</a> All the positive definitions of
religion are based on reciprocity. The religious man thinks of God
because God thinks of him; he loves God because God has first loved
him. God is jealous of man; religion is jealous of morality;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5276src" href="#xd21e5276" name="xd21e5276src">5</a>
it sucks away the best forces of morality; it renders to man only the
things that are man&rsquo;s, but to God the things that are
God&rsquo;s; and to him is rendered true, living emotion,&mdash;the
heart.</p>
<p>When in times in which peculiar sanctity was attached to religion,
we find marriage, property, and civil law respected, this has not its
foundation in religion, but in the original, natural sense of morality
and right, to which the true social relations are sacred <i>as
such</i>. He to whom the Right is not holy for its own sake will never
be made to feel it sacred by religion. Property did not become sacred
because it was regarded as a divine institution, but it was regarded as
a divine institution because it was felt to be in itself sacred. Love
is not holy because it is a predicate of God, but it is a predicate of
God because it is in itself divine. The heathens do not worship the
light or the fountain because it is a gift of God, but because it has
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>itself a beneficial influence on man, because it
refreshes the sufferer; on account of this excellent quality they pay
it divine honours.</p>
<p>Wherever morality is based on theology, wherever the right is made
dependent on divine authority, the most immoral, unjust, infamous
things can be justified and established. I can found morality on
theology only when I myself have already defined the Divine Being by
means of morality. In the contrary case, I have no criterion of the
moral and immoral, but merely an unmoral, arbitrary basis, from which I
may deduce anything I please. Thus, if I would found morality on God, I
must first of all place it in God: for Morality, Right, in short, all
substantial relations, have their only basis in themselves, can only
have a real foundation&mdash;such as truth demands&mdash;when they are
thus based. To place anything in God, or to derive anything from God,
is nothing more than to withdraw it from the test of reason, to
institute it as indubitable, unassailable, sacred, without rendering an
account <i>why</i>. Hence self-delusion, if not wicked, insidious
design, is at the root of all efforts to establish morality, right, on
theology. Where we are in earnest about the right we need no incitement
or support from above. We need no Christian rule of political right: we
need only one which is rational, just, human. The right, the true, the
good, has always its ground of sacredness in itself, in its quality.
Where man is in earnest about ethics, they have in themselves the
validity of a divine power. If morality has no foundation in itself,
there is no inherent necessity for morality; morality is then
surrendered to the groundless arbitrariness of religion.</p>
<p>Thus the work of the self-conscious reason in relation to religion
is simply to destroy an illusion:&mdash;an illusion, however, which is
by no means indifferent, but which, on the contrary, is profoundly
injurious in its effect on mankind; which deprives man as well of the
power of real life as of the genuine sense of truth and virtue; for
even love, in itself the deepest, truest emotion, becomes by means of
religiousness merely ostensible, illusory, since religious love gives
itself to man only for God&rsquo;s sake, so that it is given only in
appearance to man, but in reality to God.</p>
<p>And we need only, as we have shown, invert the religious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>relations&mdash;regard that as an end which
religion supposes to be a means&mdash;exalt that into the primary which
in religion is subordinate, the accessory, the condition,&mdash;at once
we have destroyed the illusion, and the unclouded light of truth
streams in upon us. The sacraments of Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, which are the characteristic symbols of the Christian religion,
may serve to confirm and exhibit this truth.</p>
<p>The Water of Baptism is to religion only the means by which the Holy
Spirit imparts itself to man. But by this conception it is placed in
contradiction with reason, with the truth of things. On the one hand,
there is virtue in the objective, natural quality of water; on the
other, there is none, but it is a merely arbitrary medium of divine
grace and omnipotence. We free ourselves from these and other
irreconcilable contradictions, we give a true significance to Baptism,
only by regarding it as a symbol of the value of water itself. Baptism
should represent to us the wonderful but natural effect of water on
man. Water has, in fact, not merely physical effects, but also, and as
a result of these, moral and intellectual effects on man. Water not
only cleanses man from bodily impurities, but in water the scales fall
from his eyes: he sees, he thinks more clearly; he feels himself freer;
water extinguishes the fire of appetite. How many saints have had
recourse to the natural qualities of water in order to overcome the
assaults of the devil! What was denied by Grace has been granted by
Nature. Water plays a part not only in dietetics, but also in moral and
mental discipline. To purify oneself, to bathe, is the first, though
the lowest of virtues.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5311src" href=
"#xd21e5311" name="xd21e5311src">6</a> In the stream of water the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>fever of selfishness is allayed. Water is the
readiest means of making friends with Nature. The bath is a sort of
chemical process, in which our individuality is resolved into the
objective life of Nature. The man rising from the water is a new, a
regenerate man. The doctrine that morality can do nothing without means
of grace has a valid meaning if, in place of imaginary, supernatural
means of grace, we substitute natural means. Moral feeling can effect
nothing without Nature; it must ally itself with the simplest natural
means. The profoundest secrets lie in common everyday things, such as
supranaturalistic religion and speculation ignore, thus sacrificing
real mysteries to imaginary, illusory ones; as here, for example, the
real power of water is sacrificed to an imaginary one. Water is the
simplest means of grace or healing for the maladies of the soul as well
as of the body. But water is effectual only where its use is constant
and regular. Baptism, as a single act, is either an altogether useless
and unmeaning institution, or, if real effects are attributed to it, a
superstitious one. But it is a rational, a venerable institution, if it
is understood to typify and celebrate the moral and physical curative
virtues of water.</p>
<p>But the sacrament of water required a supplement. Water, as a
universal element of life, reminds us of our origin from Nature, an
origin which we have in common with plants and animals. In Baptism we
bow to the power of a pure Nature-force; water is the element of
natural equality and freedom, the mirror of the golden age. But we men
are distinguished from the plants and animals, which together with the
inorganic kingdom we comprehend under the common name of
Nature;&mdash;we are distinguished from Nature. Hence we must celebrate
our distinction, our specific difference. The symbols of this our
difference are bread and wine. Bread and wine are, as to their
materials, products of Nature; as to their form, products of man. If in
water we declare: Man can do nothing without Nature; by bread and wine
we declare: Nature needs man, as man needs Nature. In water, human
mental activity is nullified; in bread and wine it attains
self-satisfaction. Bread and wine are supernatural products,&mdash;in
the only valid and true sense, the sense which is not in contradiction
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>with reason and Nature. If in water we adore the
pure force of Nature, in bread and wine we adore the supernatural power
of mind, of consciousness, of man. Hence this sacrament is only for man
matured into consciousness; while baptism is imparted to infants. But
we at the same time celebrate here the true relation of mind to Nature:
Nature gives the material, mind gives the form. The sacrament of
Baptism inspires us with thankfulness towards Nature, the sacrament of
bread and wine with thankfulness towards man. Bread and wine typify to
us the truth that Man is the true God and Saviour of man.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking is the mystery of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper;&mdash;eating and drinking is, in fact, in itself a religious
act; at least, ought to be so.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5323src"
href="#xd21e5323" name="xd21e5323src">7</a> Think, therefore, with
every morsel of bread which relieves thee from the pain of hunger, with
every draught of wine which cheers thy heart, of the God who confers
these beneficent gifts upon thee,&mdash;think of man! But in thy
gratitude towards man forget not gratitude towards holy Nature! Forget
not that wine is the blood of plants, and flour the flesh of plants,
which are sacrificed for thy well-being! Forget not that the plant
typifies to thee the essence of Nature, which lovingly surrenders
itself for thy enjoyment! Therefore forget not the gratitude which thou
owest to the natural qualities of bread and wine! And if thou art
inclined to smile that I call eating and drinking religious acts,
because they are common everyday acts, and are therefore performed by
multitudes without thought, without emotion; reflect, that the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper is to multitudes a thoughtless, emotionless act,
because it takes place often; and, for the sake of comprehending the
religious significance of bread and wine, place thyself in a position
where the daily act is unnaturally, violently interrupted. Hunger and
thirst destroy not only the physical but also the mental and moral
powers of man; they rob <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href=
"#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>him of his humanity&mdash;of
understanding, of consciousness. Oh! if thou shouldst ever experience
such want, how wouldst thou bless and praise the natural qualities of
bread and wine, which restore to thee thy humanity, thy intellect! It
needs only that the ordinary course of things be interrupted in order
to vindicate to common things an uncommon significance, <i>to life, as

Christian baptism also is obviously only a relic of the ancient
Nature-worship, in which, as in the Persian, water was a means of
religious purification. (S. Rhode: Die heilige Sage, &amp;c., pp. 305,
426.) Here, however, water baptism had a much truer, and consequently a
deeper meaning, than with the Christians, because it rested on the
natural power and value of water. But indeed for these simple views of
Nature which characterised the old religions, our speculative as well
as theological supranaturalism has neither sense nor understanding.
When therefore the Persians, the Hindoos, the Egyptians, the Hebrews,
made physical purity a religious duty, they were herein far wiser than
the Christian saints, who attested the supranaturalistic principle of
their religion by physical impurity. Supranaturalism in theory becomes
anti-naturalism in practice. Supranaturalism is only a euphemism for
anti-naturalism.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first"><i>Man has his highest being, his God, in himself</i>;
not in himself as an individual, but in his essential nature, his
species. No individual is an adequate representation of his species,
but only the human individual is conscious of the distinction between
the species and the individual; in the sense of this distinction lies
the root of religion. The yearning of man after something above himself
is nothing else than the longing after the perfect type of his nature,
the yearning to be free from himself, <i>i.e.</i>, from the limits and
defects of his individuality. Individuality is the self-conditionating,
the self-limitation of the species. Thus man has cognisance of nothing
above himself, of nothing beyond the nature of humanity; but to the
individual man this nature presents itself under the form of an
individual man. Thus, for example, the child sees the nature of man
<i>above itself</i> in the form of its parents, the pupil in the form
of his tutor. But all feelings which man experiences towards a superior
man, nay, in general, all moral feelings which man has towards man, are
of a religious nature.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5355src" href=
"#xd21e5355" name="xd21e5355src">1</a> <i>Man feels nothing towards God
which he does not also feel towards man. Homo homini deus est.</i> Want
teaches prayer; but in misfortune, in sorrow, man kneels to entreat
help of man also. Feeling makes God a man, but for the same reason it
makes man a God. How often in deep emotion, which alone speaks genuine
truth, man exclaims to man: Thou art, thou hast been my redeemer, my
saviour, my protecting spirit, my God! We feel awe, reverence,
humility, devout admiration, in thinking of a truly great, noble man;
we feel ourselves worthless, we sink into nothing, even in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>the
presence of human greatness. The purely, truly human emotions are
religious; but for that reason the religious emotions are purely human:
the only difference is, that the religious emotions are vague,
indefinite; but even this is only the case when the object of them is
indefinite. Where God is positively defined, is the object of positive
religion, there God is also the object of positive, definite human
feelings, the object of fear and love, and therefore he is a positively
human being; for there is nothing more in God than what lies in
feeling. If in the heart there is fear and terror, in God there is
anger; if in the heart there is joy, hope, confidence, in God there is
love. Fear makes itself objective in anger; joy in love, in mercy.
&ldquo;As it is with me in my heart, so is it with God.&rdquo;
&ldquo;As my heart is, so is God.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. i. p. 72).
But a merciful and angry God&mdash;<i>Deus vere irascitur</i>
(Melancthon)&mdash;is a God no longer distinguishable from the human
feelings and nature. Thus even in religion man bows before the nature
of man under the form of a personal human being; religion itself
expressly declares&mdash;and all anthropomorphisms declare this in
opposition to Pantheism.&mdash;<i>quod supra nos nihil ad nos</i>; that
is, a God who inspires us with no human emotions, who does not reflect
our own emotions, in a word, who is not a man,&mdash;such a God is
nothing to us, has no interest for us, does not concern us. (See the
passages cited in this work from Luther.)</p>
<p>Religion has thus no dispositions and emotions which are peculiar to
itself; what it claims as belonging exclusively to its object, are
simply the same dispositions and emotions that man experiences either
in relation to himself (as, for example, to his conscience), or to his
fellow-man, or to Nature. You must not fear men, but God; you must not
love man,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, not truly, for his own sake,&mdash;but
God; you must not humble yourselves before human greatness, but only
before the Lord; not believe and confide in man, but only in God. Hence
comes the danger of worshipping false gods in distinction from the true
God. Hence the &ldquo;jealousy&rdquo; of God. &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Ego Jehova, Deus tuus, Deus sum zelotypus. Ut zelotypus vir
dicitur, qui rivalem pati nequit: sic Deus socium in cultu, quem ab
hominibus postulat, ferre non potest.</span>&rdquo; (Clericus, Comment.
in Exod. c. 20, v. 5.) Jealousy arises because a being preferred and
loved by me directs to another the feelings and dispositions which I
claim for myself. But how could I be jealous if the impressions and
emotions which I excite in the beloved being were altogether peculiar
and apart, were essentially different from the impressions which
another can make on him? If, therefore, the emotions of religion were
objectively, essentially different from those which lie out of
religion, there would be no possibility of idolatry in man or of
jealousy in God. As the flute has another sound to me than the trumpet,
and I cannot confound the impressions produced by the former with the
impressions produced by the latter; so I could not transfer to a
natural or human being the emotions of religion, if the object of
religion, God, were specifically different from the natural or human
being, and consequently the impressions which he produced on me were
specific, peculiar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283"

<p class="first"><i>Feeling alone is the object of feeling.</i> Feeling
is sympathy; feeling arises only in the love of man to man. Sensations
man has in isolation; feelings only in community. Only in sympathy does
sensation rise into feeling. Feeling is &aelig;sthetic, human
sensation; only what is human is the object of feeling. In feeling man
is related to his fellow-man as to himself; he is alive to the sorrows,
the joys of another as his own. Thus only by communication does man
rise above merely egoistic sensation into feeling;&mdash;participated
sensation is feeling. He who has no need of participating has no
feeling. But what does the hand, the kiss, the glance, the voice, the
tone, the word&mdash;as the expression of emotion&mdash;impart?
Emotion. The very same thing which, pronounced or performed without the
appropriate tone, without emotion, is only an object of indifferent
perception, becomes, when uttered or performed with emotion, an object
of feeling. To feel is to have a sense of sensations, to have emotion
in the perception of emotion. Hence the brutes rise to feeling only in
the sexual relation, and therefore only transiently; for here the being
experiences sensation not in relation to itself taken alone, or to an
object without sensation, but to a being having like emotions with
itself,&mdash;not to another as a distinct object, but to an object
which in species is identical. Hence Nature is an object of feeling to
me only when I regard it as a being akin to me and in sympathy with
me.</p>
<p>It is clear from what has been said, that only where in truth, if
not according to the subjective conception, the distinction between the
divine and human being is abolished, is the objective existence of God,
the existence of God as an objective, distinct being,
abolished:&mdash;only there, I say, is religion made a mere matter of
feeling, or conversely, feeling the chief point in religion. The last
refuge of theology therefore is feeling. God is renounced by the
understanding; he has no longer the dignity of a real object, of a
reality which imposes itself on the understanding; hence he is
transferred to feeling; in feeling his existence is thought to be
secure. And doubtless this is the safest refuge; for to make feeling
the essence of religion is nothing else than to make feeling the
essence of God. And as certainly as I exist, so certainly does my
feeling exist; and as certainly as my feeling exists, so certainly does
my God exist. The certainty of God is here nothing else than the
self-certainty of human feeling, the yearning after God is the yearning
after unlimited, uninterrupted, pure feeling. In life the feelings are
interrupted; they collapse; they are followed by a state of void, of
insensibility. The religious problem, therefore, is to give fixity to
feeling in spite of the vicissitudes of life, and to separate it from
repugnant disturbances and limitations: God himself is nothing else
than undisturbed, uninterrupted feeling, feeling for which there exists
no limits, no opposite. If God were a being distinct from thy feeling,
he would be known to thee in some other way than simply in feeling; but
just because thou perceivest him only by feeling, he exists only in
feeling&mdash;he is himself only feeling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first"><i>God is man&rsquo;s highest feeling of self, freed
from all contrarieties or disagreeables.</i> God is the highest being;
therefore, to feel God is the highest feeling. But is not the highest
feeling also the highest feeling of self? So long as I have not had the
feeling of the highest, so long I have not exhausted my capacity of
feeling, so long I do not yet fully know the nature of feeling. What,
then, is an object to me in my feeling of the highest being? Nothing
else than the highest nature of my power of feeling. So much as a man
can feel, so much is (his) God. But the highest degree of the power of
feeling is also the highest degree of the feeling of self. In the
feeling of the <i>low</i> I feel myself lowered, in the feeling of the
<i>high</i> I feel myself exalted. The feeling of self and feeling are
inseparable, otherwise feeling would not belong to myself. Thus God, as
an object of feeling, or what is the same thing, the feeling of God, is
nothing else than man&rsquo;s highest feeling of self. But God is the
freest, or rather the absolutely only free being; thus God is
man&rsquo;s highest feeling of freedom. How couldst thou be conscious
of the highest being as freedom, or freedom as the highest being, if
thou didst not feel thyself free? But when dost thou feel thyself free?
When thou feelest God. To feel God is to feel oneself free. For
example, thou feelest desire, passion, the conditions of time and
place, as limits. What thou feelest as a limit thou strugglest against,
thou breakest loose from, thou deniest. The consciousness of a limit,
as such, is already an anathema, a sentence of condemnation pronounced
on this limit, for it is an oppressive, disagreeable, negative
consciousness. Only the feeling of the good, of the positive, is itself
good and positive&mdash;is joy. Joy alone is feeling in its element,
its paradise, because it is unrestricted activity. The sense of pain in
an organ is nothing else than the sense of a disturbed, obstructed,
thwarted activity; in a word, the sense of something abnormal,
anomalous. Hence thou strivest to escape from the sense of limitation
into unlimited feeling. By means of the will, or the imagination, thou
negativest limits, and thus obtainest the feeling of freedom. This
feeling of freedom is God. God is exalted above desire and passion,
above the limits of space and time. But this exaltation is thy own
exaltation above that which appears to thee as a limit. Does not this
exaltation of the divine being exalt thee? How could it do so, if it
were external to thee? No; God is an exalted being only for him who
himself has exalted thoughts and feelings. Hence the exaltation of the
divine being varies according to that which different men or nations
perceive as a limitation to the feeling of self, and which they
consequently negative or eliminate from their ideal. <span class=

<p class="first"><i>The distinction between the &ldquo;heathen,&rdquo;
or philosophic, and the Christian God&mdash;the non-human, or
pantheistic, and the human, personal God&mdash;reduces itself only to
the distinction between the understanding or reason and the heart or
feelings.</i> Reason is the self-consciousness of the species, as such;
feeling is the self-consciousness of individuality; the reason has
relation to existences, as things; the heart to existences, as persons.
I am is an expression of the heart; <i>I think</i>, of the reason.
<i lang="la">Cogito, ergo sum?</i> No! <i lang="la">Sentio, ergo
sum.</i> Feeling only is my existence; thinking is my non-existence,
the negation of my individuality, the positing of the species; reason
is the annihilation of personality. To think is an act of spiritual
marriage. Only beings of the same species understand each other; the
impulse to communicate thought is the intellectual impulse of sex.
Reason is cold, because its maxim is, <i lang="la">audiatur et altera
pars</i>, because it does not interest itself in man alone; but the
heart is a partisan of man. Reason loves all impartiality, but the
heart only what is like itself. It is true that the heart has pity also
on the brutes, but only because it sees in the brute something more
than the brute. The heart loves only what it identifies with itself. It
says: Whatsoever thou dost to this being, thou dost to me. The heart
loves only itself; does not get beyond itself, beyond man. The
superhuman God is nothing else than the supernatural heart; the heart
does not give us the idea of <i>another</i>, of a being different from
ourselves. &ldquo;For the heart, Nature is an echo, in which it hears
only itself. Emotion, in the excess of its happiness, transfers itself
to external things. It is the love which can withhold itself from no
existence, which gives itself forth to all; but it only recognises as
existing that which it knows to have emotion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5429src" href="#xd21e5429" name="xd21e5429src">2</a> Reason,
on the contrary, has pity on animals, not because it finds itself in
them, or identifies them with man, but because it recognises them as
beings distinct from man, not existing simply for the sake of man, but
also as having rights of their own. The heart sacrifices the species to
the individual, the reason sacrifices the individual to the species.
The man without feeling has no home, no private hearth. Feeling, the
heart, is the domestic life; the reason is the <i lang="la">res
publica</i> of man. Reason is the truth of Nature, the heart is the
truth of man. To speak popularly, reason is the God of Nature, the
heart the God of man;&mdash;a distinction however which, drawn thus
sharply, is, like the others, only admissible in antithesis. Everything
which man wishes, but which reason, which Nature denies, the heart
bestows. God, immortality, freedom, in the supranaturalistic sense,
exist only in the heart. The heart is itself the existence of God, the
existence of immortality. Satisfy yourselves with this existence! You
do not understand your heart; therein lies the evil. You desire a real,
external, objective immortality, a God out of yourselves. Here is the
source of delusion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286"
name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>But as the heart releases man from the limits, even the essential
limits of Nature; reason, on the other hand, releases Nature from the
limits of external finiteness. It is true that Nature is the light and
measure of reason;&mdash;a truth which is opposed to abstract Idealism.
Only what is <i>naturally</i> true is <i>logically</i> true; what has
no basis in Nature has no basis at all. That which is not a physical
law is not a metaphysical law. Every true law in metaphysics can and
must be verified physically. But at the same time reason is also the
light of Nature;&mdash;and this truth is the barrier against crude
materialism. Reason is the nature of things come fully to itself,
re-established in its entireness. Reason divests things of the
disguises and transformations which they have undergone in the conflict
and agitation of the external world, and reduces them to their true
character. Most, indeed nearly all, crystals&mdash;to give an obvious
illustration&mdash;appear in Nature under a form altogether different
from their fundamental one; nay, many crystals never have appeared in
their fundamental form. Nevertheless, the mineralogical reason has
discovered that fundamental form. Hence nothing is more foolish than to
place Nature in opposition to reason, as an essence in itself
incomprehensible to reason. If reason reduces transformations and
disguises to their fundamental forms, does it not effect that which
lies in the idea of Nature itself, but which, prior to the operation of
reason, could not be effected on account of external hindrances? What
else then does reason do than remove external disturbances, influences,
and obstructions, so as to present a thing as it ought to be, to make
the existence correspond to the idea; for the fundamental form is the
<i>idea</i> of the crystal. Another popular example. Granite consists
of mica, quartz, and feldspar. But frequently other kinds of stone are
mingled with it. If we had no other guide and tutor than the senses, we
should without hesitation reckon as constituent parts of granite all
the kinds of stone which we ever find in combination with it; we should
say <i>yes</i> to everything the senses told us, and so never come to
the true idea of granite. But reason says to the credulous senses:
<i>Quod non</i>. It discriminates; it distinguishes the essential from
the accidental elements. Reason is the midwife of Nature; it explains,
enlightens, rectifies and completes Nature. Now that which separates
the essential from the non-essential, the necessary from the
accidental, what is proper to a thing from what is foreign, which
restores what has been violently sundered to unity, and what has been
forcibly united to freedom,&mdash;is not this divine? Is not such an
agency as this the agency of the highest, of divine love? And how would
it be possible that reason should exhibit the pure nature of things,
the original text of the universe, if it were not itself the purest,
most original essence? But reason has no partiality for this or that
species of things. It embraces with equal interest the whole universe;
it interests itself in all things and beings without distinction,
without exception;&mdash;it bestows the same attention on the worm
which human egoism tramples under its feet, as on man, as on the sun in
the firmament. Reason is thus the all-embracing, all-compassionating
being, the love of the universe to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287"
href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>itself. To reason alone
belongs the great work of the resurrection and restoration of all
things and beings&mdash;universal redemption and reconciliation. Not
even the unreasoning animal, the speechless plant, the unsentient
stone, shall be excluded from this universal festival. But how would it
be possible that reason should interest itself in all beings without
exception, if reason were not itself universal and unlimited in its
nature? Is a limited nature compatible with unlimited interest, or an
unlimited interest with a limited nature? By what dost thou recognise
the limitation of a being but by the limitation of his interest? As far
as the interest extends, so far extends the nature. The desire of
knowledge is infinite; reason then is infinite. Reason is the highest
species of being;&mdash;hence it includes all species in the sphere of
knowledge. Reason cannot content itself in the individual; it has its
adequate existence only when it has the species for its object, and the
species not as it has already developed itself in the past and present,
but as it will develop itself in the unknown future. In the activity of
reason I feel a distinction between myself and reason in me; this
distinction is the limit of the individuality; in feeling I am
conscious of no distinction between myself and feeling; and with this
absence of distinction there is an absence also of the sense of
limitation. Hence it arises that to so many men reason appears finite,
and only feeling infinite. And, in fact, feeling, the heart of man as a
rational being, is as infinite, as universal as reason; since man only
truly perceives and understands that for which he has feeling.</p>
<p>Thus reason is the essence of Nature <i>and</i> Man, released from
non-essential limits, in their identity; it is the universal being, the
universal God. The heart, considered in its <i>difference</i> from the
reason, is the private God of man; the personal God is the heart of
man, emancipated from the limits or laws of Nature.<a class="noteref"

that thou knowest fire is hot, water cold and moist.... Know how thou
oughtest to treat thy field, thy cow, thy house and child&mdash;that is
enough of natural science for thee. Think how thou mayest learn Christ,
who will show thee thyself, who thou art, and what is thy capability.
Thus wilt thou learn God and thyself, which no natural master or
natural science ever taught.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xiii. p.
264).</p>
<p>Such quotations as these, which might be multiplied indefinitely,
show clearly enough that true, religious Christianity has within it no
principle of scientific and material culture, no motive to it. The
practical end and object of Christians is solely heaven, <i>i.e.</i>,
the realised salvation of the soul. The theoretical end and object of
Christians is solely God, as the being identical with the salvation of
the soul. He who knows God knows all things; and as God is infinitely
more than the world, so theology is infinitely more than the knowledge
of the world. Theology makes happy, for its object is personified
happiness. <i lang="la">Infelix homo, qui scit illa omnia</i> (created
things) <i lang="la">te autem nescit, Beatus autem qui te scit, etiam
si illa nesciat</i>.&mdash;Augustin (Confess. l. v. c. 4). Who then
would, who could exchange the blessed Divine Being for the unblessed
worthless things of this world? It is true that God reveals himself in
Nature, but only vaguely, dimly, only in his most general attributes;
himself, his true personal nature, he reveals only in religion, in
Christianity. The knowledge of God through Nature is heathenism; the
knowledge of God through himself, through Christ, in whom dwelt the
fulness of the Godhead bodily, is Christianity. What interest,
therefore, should Christians have in occupying themselves with
material, natural things? Occupation with Nature, culture in general,
presupposes, or, at least, infallibly produces, a heathenish, mundane,
anti-theological, anti-supranaturalistic sentiment and belief. Hence
the culture of modern Christian nations is so little to be derived from
Christianity, that it is only to be explained by the negation of
Christianity, a negation which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289"
href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>certainly was, in the first
instance, only practical. It is indeed necessary to distinguish between
what the Christians were as Christians and what they were as heathens,
as natural men, and thus between that which they have said and done in
agreement, and that which they have said and done in contradiction with
their faith. (See on this subject the author&rsquo;s <i>P.
Bayle</i>.)</p>
<p>How frivolous, therefore, are modern Christians when they deck
themselves in the arts and sciences of modern nations as products of
Christianity! How striking is the contrast in this respect between
these modern boasters and the Christians of older times! The latter
knew of no other Christianity than that which is contained in the
Christian faith, in faith in Christ; they did not reckon the treasures
and riches, the arts and sciences of this world as part of
Christianity. In all these points, they rather conceded the
pre-eminence to the ancient heathens, the Greeks and Romans. &ldquo;Why
dost thou not also wonder, Erasmus, that from the beginning of the
world there have always been among the heathens higher, rarer people,
of greater, more exalted understanding, more excellent diligence and
skill in all arts, than among Christians or the people of God? Christ
himself says that the children of this world are wiser than the
children of light. Yea, who among the Christians could we compare for
understanding or application to Cicero (to say nothing of the Greeks,
Demosthenes and others)?&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xix. p. 37). <i lang=

have made himself nearer to us?&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. pp. 533,
574). &ldquo;It is to be remarked that he (Stephen) is said to have
seen not God himself but the man Christ, whose nature is the dearest
and likest and most consoling to man, for a man would rather see a man
than an angel or any other creature, especially in
trouble.&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (Th. xiii. p. 170). &ldquo;It is not thy
kingly rule which draws hearts to thee, O wonderful heart!&mdash;but
thy having become a man in the fulness of time, and thy walk upon the
earth, full of weariness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Though thou guidest the sceptre
of the starry realm, thou art still our brother; flesh and blood never
disowns itself.&rdquo; &ldquo;The most powerful charm that melts my
heart is that my Lord died on the cross <i>for me</i>.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That it is which moves me; I love thee for thy love, that thou,
the creator, the supreme prince, becamest the Lamb of God for
me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks be to thee, dear Lamb of God, with thousands
of sinners&rsquo; tears; thou didst die for me on the cross and didst
seek me with yearning.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thy blood it is which has made me
give myself up to thee, else I had never thought of thee through my
whole life.&rdquo; &ldquo;If thou hadst not laid hold upon me, I should
never have gone to seek thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;O how sweetly the soul
feeds on the passion of Jesus! Shame and joy are stirred, O thou son of
God and of man, when in spirit we see thee so willingly go to death on
the cross for us, and each thinks: <i>for me</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Father takes us under his care, the Son washes us with his blood, the
Holy Spirit is always labouring that he may guide and teach us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah! King, great at all times, but never greater than in the
blood-stained robe of the martyr.&rdquo; &ldquo;My friend is to me and
I to him as the Cherubim over the mercy-seat: we look at each other
continually. He seeks repose in my heart, and I ever hasten towards
his: he wishes to be in my soul, and I in the wound in his side.&rdquo;
These quotations are taken from the Moravian hymn-book (Gesangbuch der
Evangelischen Br&uuml;dergemeine. Gnadau, 1824). We see clearly enough
from the examples above given, that the deepest mystery of the
Christian religion resolves itself into the mystery of human self-love,
but that religious self-love is distinguished from natural in this,
that it changes the active into the passive. It is true that the more
profound, mystical religious sentiment abhors such naked, undisguised
egoism as is exhibited in the Herrnhut hymns; it does not in God
expressly have reference to itself; it rather forgets, denies itself,
demands an unselfish, disinterested love of God, contemplates God in
relation to God, not to itself. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Causa diligendi
Deum, Deus est. Modus sine modo diligere.... Qui Domino confitetur, non
quoniam <i>sibi</i> bonus est, sed quoniam bonus est, hic vere diligit
Deum <i>propter Deum et non propter seipsum</i>. Te enim quodammodo
perdere, tanquam qui non sis et omnino non sentire te ipsum et a
temetipso exinaniri et pene annullari, coelestis est conversationis,
non humanae affectionis</span>&rdquo; (thus the ideal of love,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>which, however, is first realised in
heaven).&mdash;Bernhardus, <span lang="la">Tract. de dilig. Deo (ad
Haymericum)</span>. But this free, unselfish love is only the
culmination of religious enthusiasm, in which the subject is merged in
the object. As soon as the distinction presents itself&mdash;and it
necessarily does so&mdash;so soon does the subject have reference to
itself as the object of God. And even apart from this: the religious
subject denies its <i>ego</i>, its personality, only because it has the
enjoyment of blissful personality in God&mdash;God <i>per se</i> the
realised salvation of the soul, God the highest self-contentment, the
highest rapture of human feeling. Hence the saying: &ldquo;<span lang=

12). When, however, the Christian religion is designated as the
religion of suffering, this of course applies only to the Christianity
of the &ldquo;mistaken&rdquo; Christians of old times. Protestantism,
in its very beginning, denied the sufferings of Christ as constituting
a principle of morality. It is precisely the distinction between
Catholicism and Protestantism, in relation to this subject, that the
latter, out of self-regard, attached itself only to the merits of
Christ, while the former, out of sympathy, attached itself to his
sufferings. &ldquo;Formerly in Popery the sufferings of the Lord were
so preached, that it was only pointed out how his example should be
imitated. After that, the time was filled up with the sufferings and
sorrows of Mary, and the compassion with which Christ and his mother
were bewailed; and the only aim was how to make it piteous, and move
the people to compassion and tears, and he who could do this well was
held the best preacher for Passion-Week. But we preach the Lord&rsquo;s
sufferings as the Holy Scripture teaches us.... Christ suffered for the
praise and glory of God ... but to me, and thee, and all of us, he
suffered in order to bring redemption and blessedness.... The cause and
end of the sufferings of Christ is comprised in this&mdash;he suffered
for us. This honour is to be given to no other
suffering.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. p. 182). &ldquo;Lamb! I weep
only for joy over thy suffering; the suffering was thine, but thy merit
is mine!&rdquo; &ldquo;I know of no joys but those which come from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>thy sufferings.&rdquo; &ldquo;It remains ever in
my mind that it cost thee thy blood to redeem me.&rdquo; &ldquo;O my
Immanuel! how sweet is it to my soul when thou permittest me to enjoy
the outpouring of thy blood.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sinners are glad at heart
that they have a Saviour ... it is wondrously beautiful to them to see
Jesus on the Cross&rdquo; (Moravian hymn-book). It is therefore not to
be wondered at if Christians of the present day decline to know
anything more of the sufferings of Christ. It is they, forsooth, who
have first made out what true Christianity is&mdash;they rely solely on
the divine word of the Holy Scriptures. And the Bible, as every one
knows, has the valuable quality that everything may be found in it
which it is desired to find. What once stood there, of course now
stands there no longer. The principle of stability has long vanished
from the Bible. Divine revelation is as changing as human opinion.

1700<span class="corr" id="xd21e5973" title="Not in source">)</span>.
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Ut igitur in <i>natura hominum</i> filium
dicimus genitum de substantia patris, similem patri: <i>ita</i> secunda
persona Filius dicitur, quia de substantia Patris natus est et ejus est
imago.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Melancthon (<span lang="la">Loci praecipui
Theol. Witebergae,</span> 1595, p. 30). &ldquo;As a corporeal son has
his flesh and blood and nature from his father, so also the Son of God,
born of the Father, has his divine nature from the Father of
Eternity.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. ix. p. 408). H. A. Roel, a
theologian of the school of Descartes and Coccejus, had advanced this
thesis: &ldquo;<span lang="la">Filium Dei, Secundam Deitatis personam
<i>improprie</i> dici genitam.</span>&rdquo; This was immediately
opposed by his colleague, Camp. Vitringa, who declared it an unheard-of
thesis, and maintained: &ldquo;<span lang="la">Generationem Filii Dei
ab aeterno <i>propriissime</i> enunciari.</span>&rdquo; Other
theologians also contended against Roel, and declared:
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Generationem in Deo esse maxime veram et
propriam.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Acta Erudit. Supplem. T. i. S. vii. p.
377, etc.). That in the Bible also the <i lang="la">Filius Dei</i>
signifies a real son is unequivocally implied in this passage:
&ldquo;God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten
Son.&rdquo; If the love of God, which this passage insists upon, is to
be regarded as a truth, then the Son also must be a truth, and, in
plain language, a physical truth. On this lies the emphasis that God
gave his own Son for us&mdash;in this alone the proof of his great
love. Hence the Herrnhut hymn-book correctly apprehends the sense of
the Bible when it says of &ldquo;the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who is also our Father:&rdquo; &ldquo;His Son is not too dear. No! he
gives him up for me, that he may save me from the eternal fire by his
dear blood. Thou hast so loved the world that thy heart consents to
give up the Son, thy joy and life, to suffering and death.&rdquo;

<p>God is a threefold being, a trinity of persons, means: God is not
only a metaphysical, abstract, spiritual, but a physical being. The
central point of the Trinity is the Son, for the Father is Father only
through the Son; but the mystery of the generation of the Son is the
mystery of physical nature. The Son is the need of sensuousness, or of
the heart, satisfied in God; for all wishes of the heart, even the wish
for a personal God and for heavenly felicity, are sensuous
wishes;&mdash;the heart is essentially materialistic, it contents
itself only with an object which is seen and felt. This is especially
evident in the conception that the Son, even in the midst of the Divine
Trinity, has the human body as an essential, permanent attribute.
Ambrosius: &ldquo;<span lang="la">Scriptum est Ephes. i.: Secundum
carnem igitur omnia ipsi subjecta traduntur.&rdquo; Chrysostomus:
&ldquo;Christum secundum carnem pater jussit a cunctis angelis
adorari.&rdquo; Theodoretus: &ldquo;Corpus Dominicum surrexit quidem a
mortuis, divina glorificata gloria ... corpus tamen est et habet, quam
prius habuit, circumscriptionem.</span>&rdquo; (See <span lang=
"de">Concordienbuchs-anhang</span>. &ldquo;<span lang="de">Zeugnisse

L. l. iii. dist. 10, cc. 1, 2. See also on this subject Luther, Th.
xix. pp. 464&ndash;468.) In accordance with this the United Brethren
say: &ldquo;I will ever embrace thee in love and faith, until, when at
length my lips are pale in death, I shall see thee bodily.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thy eyes, thy mouth, the body wounded for us, on which we so
firmly rely,&mdash;all that I shall behold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence the Son of God is the darling of the human heart, the
bridegroom of the soul, the object of a formal, personal love.

<p>The distinction between God <i>with</i> the Son, or the sensuous
God, and God <i>without</i> the Son, or God divested of sensuousness,
is nothing further than the distinction between the mystical and the
rational man. The rational man <i>lives</i> and <i>thinks</i>; with him
life is the complement of thought, and thought the complement of life,
both theoretically, inasmuch as he convinces himself of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>the
reality of sensuousness through the reason itself, and practically,
inasmuch as he combines activity of life with activity of thought. That
which I have in life, I do not need to posit beyond life, in spirit, in
metaphysical existence, in God; love, friendship, perception, the world
in general, give me what thought does not, cannot give me, nor ought to
give me. Therefore I dismiss the needs of the heart from the sphere of
thought, that reason may not be clouded by desires;&mdash;in the
demarcation of activities consists the wisdom of life and
thought;&mdash;I do not need a God who supplies by a mystical,
imaginary physicalness or sensuousness the absence of the real. My
heart is satisfied before I enter into intellectual activity; hence my
thought is cold, indifferent, abstract, <i>i.e.</i>, free, in relation
to the heart, which oversteps its limits, and improperly mixes itself
with the affairs of the reason. Thus I do not think in order to satisfy
my heart, but to satisfy my reason, which is not satisfied by the
heart; I think only in the interest of reason, from pure desire of
knowledge, I seek in God only the contentment of the pure, unmixed
intelligence. Necessarily, therefore, the God of the rational thinker
is another than the God of the heart, which in thought, in reason, only
seeks its own satisfaction. And this is the aim of the mystic, who
cannot endure the luminous fire of discriminating and limiting
criticism; for his mind is always beclouded by the vapours which rise
from the unextinguished ardour of his feelings. He never attains to
abstract, <i>i.e.</i>, disinterested, free thought, and for that reason
he never attains to the perception of things in their naturalness,
truth, and reality.</p>
<p>One more remark concerning the Trinity. The older theologians said
that the essential attributes of God as God were made manifest by the
light of natural reason. But how is it that reason can know the Divine
Being, unless it be because the Divine Being is nothing else than the
objective nature of the intelligence itself? Of the Trinity, on the
other hand, they said that it could only be known through
revelation<span class="corr" id="xd21e6119" title="Source: ,">.</span>
Why not through reason; because it contradicts reason, <i>i.e.</i>,
because it does not express a want of the reason, but a sensuous,
emotional want. In general, the proposition that an idea springs from
revelation means no more than that it has come to us by the way of
tradition. The dogmas of religion have arisen at certain times out of
definite wants, under definite relations and conceptions; for this
reason, to the men of a later time, in which these relations, wants,
conceptions, have disappeared, they are something unintelligible,
incomprehensible, only traditional, <i>i.e.</i>, revealed. The
antithesis of revelation and reason reduces itself only to the
antithesis of history and reason, only to this, that mankind at a given
time is no longer capable of that which at another time it was quite
capable of; just as the individual man does not unfold his powers at
all times indifferently, but only in moments of special appeal from
without or incitement from within. Thus the works of genius arise only
under altogether special inward and outward conditions which cannot
thus coincide more than once; they are <span class="trans" title=
"apax legomena"><span class="Greek" lang="el">&#7940;&pi;&alpha;&xi;
&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&#8057;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;</span></span>.
&ldquo;<span lang="de">Einmal ist alles wahre nur.</span>&rdquo; The
true is born but once. Hence a man&rsquo;s own works often <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>appear to him in later years quite strange and
incomprehensible. He no longer knows how he produced them or could
produce them, <i>i.e.</i>, he can no longer explain them out of
himself, still less reproduce them. And just as it would be folly if,
in riper years, because the productions of our youth have become
strange and inexplicable to us in their tenor and origin, we were to
refer them to a special inspiration from above; so it is folly, because
the doctrines and ideas of a past age are no longer recognised by the
reason of a subsequent age, to claim for them a supra- and extra-human,
<i>i.e.</i>, an imaginary, illusory origin.</p>

<p class="first"><i>The creation out of nothing expresses the
non-divineness, non-essentiality</i>, i.e., <i>the nothingness of the
world</i>.</p>
<p>That is <i>created</i> which once did not exist, which some time
will exist no longer, to which, therefore, it is possible not to exist,
which we can think of as not existing, in a word, which has not its
existence in itself, is not necessary. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Cum enim
res producantur ex suo non-esse, possunt ergo absolute non-esse,
adeoque implicat, quod non sunt
necessari&aelig;.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Duns Scotus (ap. Rixner, B. ii.
p. 78). But only necessary existence is existence. If I am not
necessary, do not feel myself necessary, I feel that it is all one
whether I exist or not, that thus my existence is worthless, nothing.
&ldquo;I am nothing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am not necessary,&rdquo; is
fundamentally the same thing. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Creatio non est
motus, sed simplicis divinae voluntatis vocatio ad esse eorum, quae
<i>antea nihil fuerunt et secundum se ipsa et nihil sunt et ex nihilo
sunt</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Albertus M. (de. Mirab. Scient. Dei P.
ii. Tr. i. Qu. 4, Art. 5, memb. ii.) But the position that the world is
not necessary, has no other bearing than to prove that the extra- and
supra-mundane being (<i>i.e.</i>, in fact, the human being) is the only
necessary, only real being. Since the one is non-essential and
temporal, the other is necessarily the essential, existent, eternal.
The creation is the proof that God is, that he is exclusively true and
real. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Sanctus Dominus Deus omnipotens in
principio, quod est in te, in sapientia tua, quae nata est de
substantia tua, fecisti aliquid et de nihilo. Fecisti enim coelum et
terram <i>non de te</i>, nam <i>esset aequale</i> unigenito tuo, ac per
hoc et tibi, et <i>nullo modo justum esset</i>, ut <i>aequale tibi
esset, quod in te non esset</i>. Et aliud praeter te non erat, unde
faceres ea Deus.... Et ideo <i>de nihilo</i> fecisti coelum et
terram.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Augustinus (<span lang="la">Confessionum l.

quia <i>incommutabilis</i> est. Omnis enim mutatio facit non esse quod

<i>quia ex nihilo</i> id est <i>ex eo quod omnino non
est</i>&mdash;fecit, mutabilia sunt.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Augustin
(<span lang="la">de nat. boni adv. Manich. cc. 1, 19</span>).
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Creatura <i>in nullo debet parificari</i> Deo,
si autem non habuisset <i>initium durationis</i> et <i>esse</i>, in hoc
<i>parificaretur</i> Deo.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Albertus M. l. c.
Quaest. incidens 1). The positive, the essential in the world is not
that which makes it a world, which distinguishes it from God&mdash;this
is precisely its finiteness and nothingness&mdash;but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>rather that in it which is not itself, which is
God. &ldquo;All creatures are a pure nothing ... they have no essential
existence, for their existence hangs on the presence of God. If God
turned himself away a moment, they would fall to
nothing.&rdquo;&mdash;(<span lang="de">Predigten vor. u. zu. Tauleri
Zeiten</span>, ed. c. p. 29. See also Augustine, <i>e.g.</i> Confess.
l. vii. c. 11). This is quite correctly said from the standpoint of
religion, for God is the principle of existence, the being of the
world, though he is represented as a personal being distinct from the
world. The world lasts so long as God wills. The world is transient,
but man eternal. &ldquo;<span lang="la"><i>Quamdiu vult</i>, omnia ejus
virtute manent atque consistunt, et <i>finis</i> eorum in <i>Dei
voluntatem</i> recurrit, et <i>ejus arbitrio</i>

&ldquo;<span lang="la"><i>Spiritus</i> enim a Deo creati <i>nunquam
esse desinunt</i>.... <i>Corpora coelestia</i> tam diu conservantur,
<i>quamdiu Deus ea vult permanere</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Buddeus
(Comp. l. ii. c. ii. &sect; 47). &ldquo;The dear God does not alone
create, but what he creates he keeps with his own being, until he wills
that it shall be no longer. For the time will come when the sun, moon,
and stars shall be no more.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. ix. s. 418).
&ldquo;The end will come sooner than we think.&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (Th.
xi. s. 536). By means of the creation out of nothing man gives himself
the certainty that the world is nothing, is powerless against man.
&ldquo;We have a Lord who is greater than the whole world; we have a
Lord so powerful, that when he only speaks all things are born....
Wherefore should we fear, since he is favourable to
us?&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (Th. vi. p. 293). Identical with the belief in the
creation out of nothing is the belief in the eternal life of man, in
the victory over death, the last constraint which nature imposes on
man&mdash;in the resurrection of the dead. &ldquo;Six thousand years
ago the world was nothing; and who has made the world?... The same God
and Creator can also awake thee from the dead; he will do it, and can
do it.&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (Th. xi. p. 426. See also 421, &amp;c.)
&ldquo;We Christians are greater and more than all creatures, not in or
by ourselves, but through the gift of God in Christ, against whom the
world is nothing, and can do nothing.&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (Th. xi. p.

Christians blamed the Jews for this arrogance, but only because the

Accordingly, we find the same thoughts and sentiments in the Christians
as in the Israelites. &ldquo;Know that God so takes thee unto himself
that thy enemies are his enemies.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (T. vi. p. 99).
&ldquo;It is the Christians for whose sake God spares the whole

the sake of the pious and thankful.&rdquo; (T. xvi. p. 506.) &ldquo;He
who despises me despises God.&rdquo; (T. xi. p. 538.) &ldquo;God

quia ipsi cura est de omnibus. Providentiam ergo et curam universaliter
de cunctis, quae condidit, habet.... Sed <i>specialem</i> providentiam
atque curam habet de rationalibus.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Petrus L. (l. i.
dist. 39, c. 3). Here we have again an example how Christian sophistry
is a product of Christian faith, especially of faith in the Bible as
the word of God. First we read that God cares not for oxen; then that
God cares for everything, and therefore for oxen. That is a
contradiction; but the word of God must not contradict itself. How does
faith escape from this contradiction? By distinguishing between a
general and a special providence. But <i>general</i> providence is
illusory, is in truth no providence. Only special providence is
providence in the sense of religion.</p>
<p>General providence&mdash;the providence which extends itself equally
to irrational and rational beings, which makes no distinction between
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>man and the lilies of the field or the fowls of
the air, is nothing else than the idea of Nature&mdash;an idea which
man may have without religion. The religious consciousness admits this
when it says: he who denies providence abolishes religion, places man
on a level with the brutes;&mdash;thus declaring that the providence in
which the brutes have a share is in truth no providence. Providence
partakes of the character of its object; hence the providence which has
plants and animals for its object is in accordance with the qualities
and relations of plants and animals. Providence is nothing else than
the inward nature of a thing; this inward nature is its genius, its
guardian spirit&mdash;the necessity of its existence. The higher, the
more precious a being is,&mdash;the more ground of existence it has,
the more necessary it is, the less is it open to annihilation. Every
being is necessary only through that by which it is distinguished from
other beings; its specific difference is the ground of its existence.
So man is necessary only through that by which he is distinguished from
the brutes; hence providence is nothing else than man&rsquo;s
consciousness of the necessity of his existence, of the distinction
between his nature and that of other beings; consequently that alone is
the true providence in which this specific difference of man becomes an
object to him. But this providence is special, <i>i.e.</i>, the
providence of love, for only love interests itself in what is special
to a being. Providence without love is a conception without basis,
without reality. The truth of providence is love. God loves men, not
brutes, not plants; for only for man&rsquo;s sake does he perform
extraordinary deeds, deeds of love&mdash;miracles. Where there is no
community there is no love. But what bond can be supposed to unite
brutes, or natural things in general, with God? God does not recognise
himself in them, for they do not recognise him;&mdash;where I find
nothing of myself, how can I love? &ldquo;God who thus promises, does
not speak with asses and oxen, as Paul says: Doth God take care for
oxen? but with rational creatures made in his likeness, that they may
live for ever with him.&rdquo; Luther (Th. ii. s. 156). God is first
with himself in man; in man first begins religion, providence; for the
latter is not something different from the former, on the contrary,
religion is itself the providence of man. He who loses religion,
<i>i.e.</i>, faith in himself, faith in man, in the infinite
significance of his being, in the necessity of his existence, loses
providence. He alone is forsaken who forsakes himself; he alone is lost
who despairs; he alone is without God who is without faith,
<i>i.e.</i>, without courage. Wherein does religion place the true
proof of providence? in the phenomena of Nature, as they are objects to
us out of religion,&mdash;in astronomy, in physics, in natural history?
No! In those appearances which are objects of religion, of faith only,
which express only the faith of religion in itself, <i>i.e.</i>, in the
truth and reality of man,&mdash;in the religious events, means, and
institutions which God has ordained exclusively for the salvation of
man, in a word, in miracles; for the means of grace, the sacraments,
belong to the class of providential miracles. &ldquo;<span lang=

(Med. s. M. 15). &ldquo;The heathens know God no further than that he
is a Creator.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (T. ii. p. 327). That providence has
only man for its essential object is evident from this, that to
religious faith all things and beings are created for the sake of man.
&ldquo;We are lords not only of birds, but of all living creatures, and
all things are given for our service, and are created only for our
sake.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (T. ix. p. 281). But if things are created
only for the sake of man, they are also preserved only for the sake of
man. And if things are mere instruments of man, they stand under the
protection of no law, they are, in relation to man, <i>without
rights</i>. This outlawing of things explains miracle.</p>
<p><i>The negation of providence is the negation of God.</i>
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Qui ergo providentiam tollit, totum Dei
substantiam tollit et quid dicit nisi Deum non esse?... Si non curat
humana, sive nesciens, cessat omnis causa pietatis, cum sit <i>spes
nulla salutis</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Joa. Trithemius (Tract. de
Provid. Dei). &ldquo;<span lang="la">Nam qui nihil aspici a Deo
affirmant prope est ut cui adspectum adimunt, etiam substantiam
tollant.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Salvianus (l. c. l. iv.). &ldquo;Aristotle
almost falls into the opinion that God&mdash;though he does not
expressly name him a fool&mdash;is such a one that he knows nothing of
our affairs, nothing of our designs, understands, sees, regards nothing
but himself.... But what is such a God or Lord to us? of what use is he
to us?&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (in Walch&rsquo;s Philos. Lexikon, art.
Vorsehung). Providence is therefore the most undeniable, striking proof
that in religion, in the nature of God himself, man is occupied only
with himself, that the mystery of theology is anthropology, that the
substance, the content of the infinite being, is the
&ldquo;finite&rdquo; being. &ldquo;God sees men,&rdquo; means: in God
man sees only himself; &ldquo;God cares for man,&rdquo; means: a God
who is not active is no real God. But there is no activity without an
object: it is the object which first converts activity from a mere
power into real activity. This object is man. If man did not exist, God
would have no cause for activity. Thus man is the motive principle, the
soul of God. A God who does not see and hear man, who has not man <i>in
himself</i>, is blind and deaf, i.e., inert, empty, unsubstantial. Thus
the fulness of the divine nature is the fulness of the human; thus the
<i>Godhead</i> of God is <i>humanity. I for myself</i>, is the
comfortless mystery of epicureanism, stoicism, pantheism; <i>God for
me</i>, this is the consolatory mystery of religion, of Christianity.
Is man for God&rsquo;s sake, or God for man&rsquo;s? It is true that in
religion man exists for God&rsquo;s sake, but only because God exists
for man&rsquo;s sake. I am for God because God is for me. <span class=

<p><i>The omnipotence of Providence is the omnipotence of human feeling

declared the omnipotence of prayer, of faith, before which the power of
Nature vanishes into nothing. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Mutanturquoque

is the active, the determining, God the passive, the determined. God
does the will of man. &ldquo;God does the will of those that fear him,
and he gives his will up to ours.... For the text says clearly enough,
that Lot was not to stay in all the plain, but to escape to the
mountain. But this his wish God changes, because Lot fears him and
prays to him.&rdquo; &ldquo;And we have other testimonies in the
Scriptures which prove that God allows himself to be turned and
subjects his will to our wish.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus it was according to
the regular order of God&rsquo;s power that the sun should maintain its
revolution and wonted course; but when Joshua in his need called on the
Lord and commanded the sun that it should stand still, it stood still
at Joshua&rsquo;s word. How great a miracle this was, ask the
astronomers.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (T. ii. p. 226). &ldquo;Lord, I am
here and there in great need and danger of body and soul, and therefore
want thy help and comfort. Item: I must have this and that; therefore I

appear foolish and ridiculous to reason.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;We
Christians seem fools to the world for believing that Mary was the true
mother of this child, and was nevertheless a pure virgin. For this is
not only against all reason, but also against the creation of God, who
said to Adam and Eve, <span class="corr" id="xd21e6607" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>Be fruitful and multiply.<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e6610" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;
&ldquo;We ought not to inquire whether a thing be possible, but we
should say, God has said it, therefore it will happen, even if it be
impossible. For although I cannot see or understand it, yet the Lord
can make the impossible possible, and out of nothing can make all
things.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (T. xvi. pp. 148, 149, 570). &ldquo;What is
more miraculous than that God and man is one Person? that he is the Son
of God and the Son of Mary, and yet only one Son? Who will comprehend
this mystery in all eternity, that God is man, that a creature is the
Creator, and the Creator a creature?&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (T. vii. p. 128).
The essential object of faith, therefore, is miracle; but not common,
visible miracle, which is an object even to the bold eye of curiosity
and unbelief in general; not the appearance, but the essence of
miracle; not the <i>fact</i>, but the miraculous <i>power</i>, the
Being who works miracles, who attests and reveals himself in miracle.
And this miraculous power is to faith always present; even
Protestantism believes in the uninterrupted perpetuation of miraculous
power; it only denies the necessity that it should still <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>manifest itself in special visible signs, for
the furtherance of dogmatic ends. &ldquo;Some have said that signs were
the revelation of the Spirit in the commencement of Christianity and
have now ceased. That is not correct; for there is even now such a
power, and though it is not used, that is of no importance. For we have
still the power to perform such signs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now, however, that
Christianity is spread abroad and made known to all the world, there is
no need to work miracles, as in the times of the apostles. But if there
were need for it, if the Gospel were oppressed and persecuted, we must
truly apply ourselves to this, and must also work
miracles.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xiii. pp. 642, 648). Miracle is so
essential, so natural to faith, that to it even natural phenomena are
miracles, and not in the physical sense, but in the theological,
supranaturalistic sense. &ldquo;God, in the beginning, said: Let the
earth bring forth grass and herbs, &amp;c. That same word which the
Creator spoke brings the cherry out of the dry bough and the
cherry-tree out of the little kernel. It is the omnipotence of God
which makes young fowls and geese come out of the eggs. Thus God
preaches to us daily of the resurrection of the dead, and has given us
as many examples and experiences of this article as there are
creatures.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. x. p. 432. See also Th. iii. pp.
586, 592, and Augustine, <i>e.g.</i>, Enarr. in Ps. 90, Sermo ii. c.
6). If, therefore, faith desires and needs no special miracle, this is
only because to it everything is fundamentally miracle, everything an
effect of divine, miraculous power. Religious faith has no sense, no
perception for Nature. Nature, as it exists for us, has no existence
for faith. To it the will of God is alone the ground, the bond, the
necessity of things. &ldquo;God ... could indeed have made us men, as
he did Adam and Eve, by himself, without father and mother, as he could
reign without princes, as he could give light without sun and stars,
and bread without fields and ploughs and labour. But it is not his will
to do thus.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. p. 614). It is true
&ldquo;God employs certain means, and so conducts his miraculous works
as to use the service of Nature and instruments.&rdquo; Therefore we
ought&mdash;truly on very natural grounds&mdash;&ldquo;not to despise
the means and instruments of Nature.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus it is allowable
to use medicine, nay, it ought to be used, for it is a means created in
order to preserve health.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. i. p. 508).
But&mdash;and that alone is decisive&mdash;it is <i>not necessary</i>
that I should use natural means in order to be cured; I can be cured
immediately by God. What God ordinarily does by means of Nature, he can
also do without, nay, in opposition to Nature, and actually does it
thus, in extraordinary cases, when he will. &ldquo;God,&rdquo; says
Luther in the same place, &ldquo;could indeed easily have preserved
Noah and the animals through a whole year without food, as he preserved
Moses, Elijah, and Christ forty days without any food.&rdquo; Whether
he does it often or seldom is indifferent; it is enough if he only does
it once; what happens once can happen innumerable times. A single
miracle has universal significance&mdash;the significance of an
example. &ldquo;This deed, the passage through the Red Sea, happened as
a figure and example, to show us that it will be so with
us.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. iii. p. 596). &ldquo;These miracles are
written <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>for us, who are chosen.&rdquo;&mdash;Ib. (Th.
ix. p. 142). The natural means which God employs when he does no
miracle, have no more significance than those which he employs when he
performs miracles. If the animals, God so willing it, can live as well
without food as with it, food is in itself as unnecessary for the
preservation of life, as indifferent, as non-essential, as arbitrary,
as the clay with which Christ anointed the eyes of the blind man to
whom he restored sight, as the staff with which Moses divided the sea
(&ldquo;God could have done it just as well without the staff&rdquo;).
&ldquo;Faith is stronger than heaven and earth, or all
creatures.&rdquo; &ldquo;Faith turns water into stones; out of fire it
can bring water, and out of water fire.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. iii.
pp. 564, 565). That is to say, for faith there exists no limit, no law,
no necessity, no Nature; there exists only the will of God, against
which all things and powers are nothing. If therefore the believer,
when in sickness and distress, has recourse notwithstanding to natural
means, he only follows the voice of his natural reason. The one means
of cure which is congruous with faith, which does not contradict faith,
which is not thrust upon it, whether consciously and voluntarily or
not, from without,&mdash;the one remedy for all evil and misery is
prayer; for &ldquo;prayer is almighty.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. iv. p.
27). Why then use a natural means also? For even in case of its
application, the effect which follows is by no means its own, but the
effect of the supernatural will of God, or rather the effect of faith,
of prayer; for prayer, faith determines the will of God. &ldquo;Thy
faith hath saved thee.&rdquo; Thus the natural means which faith
recognises in practice it nullifies in theory, since it makes the
effect of such means an effect of God,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, an effect
which could have taken place just as well without this means. The
natural effect is therefore nothing else than a circumstantial, covert,
concealed miracle; a miracle however which has not the appearance of a
miracle, but can only be perceived as such by the eyes of faith. Only
in expression, not in fact, is there any difference between an
immediate and mediate, a miraculous and natural operation of God. When
faith makes use of a natural means, <i>it speaks otherwise than it
thinks</i>; when it supposes a miracle <i>it speaks as it thinks</i>,
but in both cases it thinks the same. In the mediate agency of God
faith is in disunion with itself, for the senses here deny what faith
affirms; in miracle, on the contrary, it is at one with itself, for
there the appearance coincides with the reality, the senses with faith,
the expression with the fact. Miracle is the <i>terminus technicus</i>
of faith.</p>

recognition of Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah&mdash;the conversion of
the heathens and Jews. And this conversion was the more pressing, the
nearer the Christians supposed the day of judgment and the destruction
of the world;&mdash;<i lang="la">periculum in mora</i>. There was not
time or opportunity for a life of quietude, for the contemplation of
monachism. Hence there necessarily reigned at that time a more
practical and even liberal sentiment than at a later period, when
Christianity had attained to worldly dominion, and thus the enthusiasm
of proselytism was extinguished. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Apostoli
<span lang="en">(says the Church, quite correctly: Carranza, l. c. p.
256)</span> <i>cum fides inciperet</i>, ad <i>fidelium
imbecillitatem</i> se magis demittebant, cum autem evangelii
praedicatio sit magis ampliata, oportet et Pontifices ad perfectam
continentiam vitam suam dirigere.</span>&rdquo; When once Christianity
realised itself in a worldly form, it must also necessarily develop the
supranaturalistic, supramundane tendency of Christianity into a literal
separation from the world. And this disposition to separation from
life, from the body, from the world,&mdash;this first hyper-cosmic then
anti-cosmic tendency, is a genuinely biblical disposition and spirit.
In addition to the passages already cited, and others universally
known, the following may stand as examples: &ldquo;He that hateth his
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good
thing.&rdquo;&mdash;<a class="biblink xd21e48" title=

8</a>. Thus, according to these passages, the partition-wall between
God and man is the body (at least the fleshly, actual body); thus the
body as a hindrance to union with God is something worthless, to be
denied. That by the world, which is denied in Christianity, is by no
means to be understood a life of mere sensuality, but the real
objective world, is to be inferred in a popular manner from the belief
that at the advent of the Lord, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class=

consummation of the Christian religion, heaven and earth will pass
away.</p>
<p>The difference between the belief of the Christians and that of the
heathen philosophers as to the destruction of the world is not to be
overlooked. The Christian destruction of the world is only a crisis of
faith,&mdash;the separation of the Christian from all that is
anti-christian, the triumph of faith over the world, a judgment of God,
an anti-cosmical, supernaturalistic act. &ldquo;But the heavens and the
earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto
fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly
men.&rdquo;&mdash;<a class="biblink xd21e48" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pt%203:7">2 Pet. iii.
7</a>. The heathen destruction of the world is a crisis of the cosmos
itself, a process which takes place according to law, which is founded
in the constitution of Nature. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Sic origo mundi,
non minus solem et lunam et vices siderum et animalium ortus, quam
quibus mutarentur terrena, continuit. In his fuit inundatio, quae non
secus quam hiems, quam aestas, <i>lege mundi</i>
venit.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Seneca (Nat. Qu. l. iii. c. 29). It is the
principle of life immanent in the world, the essence of the world
itself, which evolves this crisis out of itself. &ldquo;<span lang=
"la"><i>Aqua et ignis</i> terrenis dominantur. <i>Ex his ortus et ex
his interitus est.</i></span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Ibid. c. 28.)
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Quidquid est, non erit; nec peribit, sed
resolvetur.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Idem. Epist. 71.) The Christians
excluded themselves from the destruction of the world. &ldquo;And he
shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet; and they shall
gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven
to the other.&rdquo;&mdash;<a class="biblink xd21e48" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2024:31">Matt. xxiv.
31</a>. &ldquo;But there shall not a hair of your head perish.... And
then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and
great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up
and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth
nigh.&rdquo;&mdash;<a class="biblink xd21e48" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2021:18-28">Luke xxi.
18, 27, 28</a>. &ldquo;Watch ye therefore and pray always, that ye may
be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass,
and to stand before the Son of Man.&rdquo;&mdash;Ib. 36. The heathens,
on the contrary, identified their fate with the fate of the world.
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Hoc universum, quod omnia divina humanaque
complectitur ... dies aliquis dissipabit et in confusionem veterem
tenebrasque demerget. <i>Eat nunc aliquis et singulas comploret
animas.</i> Quis tam superbae impotentisque arrogantiae est, ut in hac
naturae necessitate, omnia ad eundem finem revocantis, <i>se unum ac

20, 21). &ldquo;<span lang="la">Ergo quandoque erit terminus rebus
humanis.... Non muri quenquam, non turres tuebuntur. <i>Non proderunt
templa supplicibus</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Nat. Qu. L. iii. c. 29.)
Thus here we have again the characteristic distinction between
heathenism and Christianity. The heathen forgot himself in the world,
the Christian forgot the world in himself. And as the heathen
identified his destruction with the destruction of the world, so he
identified his immortality with the immortality of the world. To the
heathen, man was a common, to the Christian, a select being; to the
latter immortality was a privilege of man, to the former a common good
which he vindicated to himself only because, and in so far as, he
assigned to other beings a share in it also. The Christians expected
the destruction of the world immediately, because the Christian
religion has in it no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href=
"#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>cosmical principle of
development:&mdash;all which developed itself in Christendom developed
itself only in contradiction with the original nature of
Christianity;&mdash;because by the existence of God in the flesh,
<i>i.e.</i>, by the immediate identity of the species with the
individual, everything was attained, the thread of history was cut
short, no other thought of the future remained than the thought of a
repetition of the second coming of the Lord. The heathens, on the
contrary, placed the destruction of the world in the distant future,
because, living in the contemplation of the universe, they did not set
heaven and earth in motion on their own account,&mdash;because they
extended and freed their self-consciousness by the consciousness of the
species, placed immortality only in the perpetuation of the species,
and thus did not reserve the future to themselves, but left it to the
coming generations. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Veniet tempus quo posteri
nostri tam aperta nos nescisse mirentur.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Seneca
(Nat. Qu. l. vii. c. 25). He who places immortality in himself
abolishes the principle of historical development. The Christians did
indeed, according to Peter, expect a new heaven and a new earth. But
with this Christian, <i>i.e.</i>, superterrestrial earth, the theatre
of history is for ever closed, the end of the actual world is come. The
heathens, on the contrary, set no limits to the development of the
cosmos; they supposed the world to be destroyed only to arise again
renovated as a real world; they granted it eternal life. The Christian
destruction of the world was a matter of feeling, an object of fear and
longing; the heathen, a matter of reason, an inference from the
contemplation of nature.</p>

<p>Now if abstinence from the satisfaction of the sensual impulse, the
negation of difference of sex and consequently of sexual
love,&mdash;for what is this without the other?&mdash;is the principle
of the Christian heaven and salvation; then necessarily the
satisfaction of the sexual impulse, sexual love, on which marriage is
founded, is the source of sin and evil. And so it is held. The mystery
of original sin is the mystery of sexual desire. All men are conceived
in sin because they were conceived with sensual, <i>i.e.</i>, natural
pleasure. The act of generation, as an act of sensual enjoyment, is
sinful. Sin is propagated from Adam down to us, simply because its
propagation is the natural act of generation. This is the mystery of
Christian original sin. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Atque hic quam alienus a
vero sit, etiam hic reprehenditur, quod <i>voluptatem</i> in homine
<i>Deo authore</i> creatam asserit principaliter. Sed hoc divinae
scriptura redarguit, quae serpentis insidiis atque illecebris infusam

x. Ep. 82). &ldquo;<span lang="la"><i>Voluptas</i> ipsa <i>sine

et ex <i>carnis delectatione</i> concepti culpam originalem nobiscum
traximus.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Gregorius (Petrus L. l. ii. dist. 30, c.
2). &ldquo;<span lang="la">Firmissime tene et nullatenus dubites, omnem
hominem, qui per <i>concubitum viri et mulieris</i> concipitur, cum

originale peccatum</i>, scl. <i>vitium concupiscentiae</i>, quod in
omnes concupiscentialiter natos per Adam
intravit.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Ibid. c. 3, see also dist. 31, c. 1.)
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Peccati causa <i>ex carne</i>
est.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Ambrosius (ibid.) &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Christus <i>peccatum</i> non habet, nec originale traxit, nec suum
addidit: <i>extra voluptatem carnalis libidinis venit</i>, non ibi fuit
<i>complexus maritalis</i>.... Omnis <i>generatus,
damnatus</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Augustinus (Serm. ad Pop. S. 294, cc.
10, 16). &ldquo;<span lang="la"><i>Homo natus de muliere</i> et <i>ob

&ldquo;<span lang="la">Peccatum quomodo non fuit, ubi libido non
defuit?... Quo pacto, inquam, aut sanctus asseretur conceptus, qui de
spiritus non est, <i>ne dicam de peccato

that is born into the world of man and woman is sinful, under
God&rsquo;s anger and curse, condemned to death.&rdquo; &ldquo;All men
born of a father and mother are children of wrath by nature, as St.
Paul testifies, Ephes. ii.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have by nature a tainted,
sinful conception and birth.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. 246, 573).
It is clear from these examples, that &ldquo;carnal
intercourse&rdquo;&mdash;even a kiss is carnal intercourse&mdash;is the
radical sin, the radical evil of mankind; and consequently the basis of
marriage, the sexual impulse, honestly outspoken, is a product of the
devil. It is true that the creature as the work of God is good, but it
has long ceased to exist as it was created. The devil has alienated the
creature from God and corrupted it to the very foundation.
&ldquo;Cursed be the ground for thy sake.&rdquo; The fall of the
creature, however, is only an hypothesis by which faith drives from its
mind the burdensome, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312"
name="pb312">312</a>]</span>disquieting contradiction, that Nature is a
product of God, and yet, as it actually is, does not harmonise with
God, <i>i.e.</i>, with the Christian sentiment.</p>
<p>Christianity certainly did not pronounce the flesh as flesh, matter
as matter, to be something sinful, impure; on the contrary, it
contended vehemently against the heretics who held this opinion and
rejected marriage. (See for example Augustin. contra Faustum, l. 29, c.
4, l. 30, c. 6. Clemens Alex. Stromata, lib. iii. and Bernard. Super
Cantica, Sermo 66.) But quite apart from the hatred to heretics which
so inspired the holy Christian Church and made it so politic, this
protest rested on grounds which by no means involved the recognition of
Nature as such, and under limitations, <i>i.e.</i>, negations, which
make the recognition of Nature merely apparent and illusory. The
distinction between the heretics and the orthodox is only this, that
the latter said indirectly, covertly, secretly, what the former
declared plainly, directly, but for that very reason offensively.
Pleasure is not separable from matter. Material pleasure is nothing
further, so to speak, than the joy of matter in itself, matter proving
itself by activity. Every joy is self-activity, every pleasure a
manifestation of force, energy. Every organic function is, in a normal
condition, united with enjoyment; even breathing is a pleasurable act,
which is not perceived as such only because it is an uninterrupted
process. He therefore who declares generation, fleshly intercourse, as
such, to be pure, but fleshly intercourse united with sensual pleasure
to be a consequence of original sin and consequently itself a sin,
acknowledges only the dead, not the living flesh&mdash;he raises a mist
before us, he condemns, rejects the act of generation, and matter in
general, though under the appearance of not rejecting it, of
acknowledging it. The unhypocritical, honest acknowledgment of sensual
life is the acknowledgment of sensual pleasure. In brief, he who, like
the Bible, like the Church, does not acknowledge fleshly
pleasure&mdash;that, be it understood, which is natural, normal,
inseparable from life&mdash;does not acknowledge the flesh. That which
is not recognised as an end in itself (it by no means follows that it
should be the ultimate end) is in truth not recognised at all. Thus he
who allows me wine only as medicine forbids me the <i>enjoyment</i> of
wine. Let not the liberal supply of wine at the wedding at Cana be
urged. For that scene transports us, by the metamorphosis of water into
wine, beyond Nature into the region of supernaturalism. Where, as in
Christianity, a supernatural, spiritual body is regarded as the true,
eternal body, <i>i.e.</i>, a body from which all objective, sensual
impulses, all flesh, all nature, is removed, there real, <i>i.e.</i>,
sensual fleshly matter is denied, is regarded as worthless,
nothing.</p>
<p>Certainly Christianity did not make celibacy a law (save at a later
period for the priests). But for the very reason that chastity, or
rather privation of marriage, of sex, is the highest, the most
transcendent, supernaturalistic, heavenly virtue, it cannot and must
not be lowered into a common object of duty; it stands above the law,
it is the virtue of Christian grace and freedom. &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Christus hortatur <i>idoneos ad coelibatum</i>, ut donum recte
tueantur; idem Christus iis, qui <i>puritatem extra conjugium</i> non,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>retinent, praecipit, ut pure in conjugio
vivant.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Melancthon. (<span lang="la">Responsio ad
Colonienses. Declam. T. iii.</span>). &ldquo;<span lang=
"la"><i>Virginitas</i> non est <i>jussa</i>, sed admonita, quia
<i>nimis est excelsa</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;<span lang="la">De modo
bene viv. (Sermo 21)</span>. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Et qui matrimonio
jungit virginem suam, benefacit, et <i>qui non jungit, melius
facit</i>. Quod igitur bonum est, non vitandum est, et quod <i>est
melius eligendum</i> est. Itaque non imponitur, sed proponitur. Et ideo
bene Apostolus dixit: De virginibus autem praeceptum non habeo,
<i>consilium</i> autem do. Ubi praeceptum est, ibi <i>lex</i> est, ubi
consilium, ibi <i>gratia</i> est.... Praeceptum enim castitatis est,
<i>consilium</i> integritatis.... Sed <i>nec vidua</i> praeceptum
accipit, sed consilium. Consilium autem non semel datum, sed <i>saepe
repetitum</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Ambrosius (<span lang="la">Liber. de
viduis</span>). That is to say: celibacy, abstinence from marriage, is
no law in the common or Jewish sense, but a law in the Christian sense,
or for the Christian sentiment, which takes Christian virtue and
perfection as the rule of conscience, as the ideal of feeling,&mdash;no
despotic but a friendly law, no public but a secret, esoteric
law&mdash;a mere counsel, <i>i.e.</i>, a law which does not venture to
express itself as a law, a law for those of finer feelings, not for the
great mass. Thou mayst marry; yes indeed! without any fear of
committing a sin, <i>i.e.</i>, a public, express, plebeian sin; but
thou dost all the better if thou dost not marry; meanwhile this is only
my undictatorial, friendly advice. <i lang="la">Omnia licent, sed omnia
non expediunt.</i> What is allowed in the first member of the sentence
is retracted in the second. <i lang="la">Licet</i>, says the man;
<i lang="la">non expedit</i>, says the Christian. But only that which
is good for the Christian is for the man, so far as he desires to be a
Christian, the standard of doing and abstaining. &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Quae non expediunt, nec licent</i>,&rdquo; such is the conclusion
arrived at by the sentiment of Christian nobility. Marriage is
therefore only an indulgence to the weakness, or rather the strength of
the flesh, a taint of nature in Christianity, a falling short of the
genuine, perfect Christian sentiment; being, however, nevertheless
good, laudable, even holy, in so far as it is the best antidote to
fornication. For its own sake, as the self-enjoyment of sexual love, it
is not acknowledged, not consecrated; thus the holiness of marriage in
Christianity is only an ostensible holiness, only illusion, for that
which is not acknowledged for its own sake is not acknowledged at all,
while yet there is a deceitful show of acknowledgment. Marriage is
sanctioned not in order to hallow and satisfy the flesh, but to
restrict the flesh, to repress it, to kill it&mdash;to drive Beelzebub
out by Beelzebub. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Quae res et viris et feminis
omnibus adest ad matrimonium et stuprum? Commixtio carnis scilicet,
cujus concupiscentiam Dominus stupro adaequavit.... Ideo virginis
principalis sanctitas, quia caret stupri
affinitati.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Tertullianus (de Exhort. Cast. c. 9).
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Et de ipso conjugis melius aliquid, quam
concessisti, monuisti.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Augustinus (Confess. x. c.
30). &ldquo;It is better to marry than to burn.&rdquo;&mdash;I Cor.
vii. 9. But how much better is it, says Tertullian, developing this
text, neither to marry nor to burn.... &ldquo;<span lang="la">Possum
dicere, quod permittitur <i>bonum non est</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Ad
Uxorem, l. i. c. 3.) &ldquo;<span lang="la">De minoribus bonis est
conjugiam, quod non meretur palmam, sed est <i>in remedium</i>....
<i>Prima</i> institutio habuit <i>praeceptum</i>, secunda
<i>indulgentiam</i>. Didicimus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314"
href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>enim ab Apostolo, humano
generi propter vitandam fornicationem indultum esse
conjugium.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Petrus Lomb. (l. iv. dist. 26, c. 2).
&ldquo;The Master of the Sentences says rightly, that in Paradise
marriage was ordained as service, but after sin as
medicine.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. i. p. 349). &ldquo;Where marriage
and virginity are compared, certainly chastity is a nobler gift than
marriage.&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (Th. i. p. 319). &ldquo;Those whom the
weakness of nature does not compel to marriage, but who are such that
they can dispense with marriage, these do rightly to abstain from
marriage.&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (Th. v. p. 538). Christian sophistry will
reply to this, that only marriage which is not Christian, only that
which is not consecrated by the spirit of Christianity, <i>i.e.</i>, in
which Nature is not veiled in pious images, is unholy. But if marriage,
if Nature is first made holy by relation to Christ, it is not the
holiness of marriage which is declared, but of Christianity; and
marriage, Nature, in and by itself, is unholy. And what is the
semblance of holiness with which Christianity invests marriage, in
order to becloud the understanding, but a pious illusion? Can the
Christian fulfil his marriage duties without surrendering himself,
willingly or not, to the passion of love? Yes indeed. The Christian has
for his object the replenishing of the Christian Church, not the
satisfaction of love. The end is holy, but the means in itself unholy.
And the end sanctifies, exculpates the means. &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Conjugalis concubitus generandi gratia non habet
culpam</span>.&rdquo; Thus the Christian, at least the true Christian,
denies, or at least is bound to deny Nature, while he satisfies it; he
does not wish for, he rather contemns the means in itself; he seeks
only the end <i lang="la">in abstracto</i>; he does with religious,
supranaturalistic horror what he does, though against his will, with
natural, sensual pleasure. The Christian does not candidly confess his
sensuality, he denies Nature before his faith, and his faith before
Nature, <i>i.e.</i>, he publicly disavows what he privately does. Oh,
how much better, truer, purer-hearted in this respect were the
heathens, who made no secret of their sensuality, than the Christians,
who, while gratifying the flesh, at the same time deny that they
gratify it! To this day the Christians adhere theoretically to their
heavenly origin and destination; to this day, out of supranaturalistic
affectation, they deny their sex, and turn away with mock modesty from
every sensuous picture, every naked statue, as if they were angels; to
this day they repress, even by legal force, every open-hearted,
ingenuous self-confession even of the most uncorrupt sensuality, only
stimulating by this public prohibition the secret enjoyment of
sensuality. What then, speaking briefly and plainly, is the distinction
between Christians and heathens in this matter? The heathens confirmed,
the Christians contradicted their faith by their lives. The heathens do
what they mean to do, the Christians what they do <i>not</i> mean: the
former, where they sin, sin with their conscience, the latter against
their conscience; the former sin simply, the latter doubly; the former
from hypertrophy, the latter from atrophy of the flesh. The specific
crime of the heathens is the ponderable, palpable crime of
licentiousness, that of the Christians is the imponderable, theological
crime of hypocrisy,&mdash;that hypocrisy of which Jesuitism is indeed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>the most striking, world-historical, but
nevertheless only a particular manifestation. &ldquo;Theology makes
sinners,&rdquo; says Luther&mdash;Luther, whose positive qualities, his
heart and understanding, so far as they applied themselves to natural
things, were not perverted by theology. And Montesquieu gives the best
commentary on this saying of Luther&rsquo;s when he says:
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">La d&eacute;votion trouve, pour faire de
mauvaises actions, des raisons, qu&rsquo;un simple honn&ecirc;te homme

magna miseria est et afflictio homini devoto, qui libenter esset
absolutus et liber ab omni peccato. Utinam non essent <i>istae

1. i. cc. 22, 25). See also on this subject S. Gregorii Nyss. de Anima
et Resurr., Lipsiae, 1837, pp. 98, 144, 153). It is true that the
Christian immortality, in distinction from the heathen, is not the
immortality of the soul, but that of the flesh, that is, of the whole
man. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Scientia immortalis visa est res illis (the
heathen philosophers) atque incorruptibilis. Nos autem, quibus divina
revelatio illuxit ... novimus, non solum <i>mentem</i>, sed <i>affectus
perpurgatos</i>, neque animam tantum, sed etiam <i>corpus ad
immortalitatem</i> assumptum iri suo tempore.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Baco
de Verul. (de Augm. Scien. 1. i.). On this account Celsus reproached
the Christians with a <i lang="la">desiderium corporis</i>. But this
immortal body is, as has been already remarked, an immaterial,
<i>i.e.</i>, a thoroughly fanciful, subjective body&mdash;a body which
is the direct negation of the real, natural body. The ideal on which
this faith hinges is not the recognition or glorification of nature, of
matter as such, but rather the reality of the emotive imagination, the
satisfaction of the unlimited, supranaturalistic desire of happiness,
to which the actual, objective body is a limitation.</p>
<p>As to what the angels strictly are, whom heavenly souls will be
like, the Bible is as far from giving us any definite information as on
other weighty subjects; it only calls them <span class="trans" title=
"pneumata"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&pi;&nu;&epsilon;&#8059;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;</span></span>,
spirits, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>declares them to be higher than men. The later
Christians expressed themselves more definitely on this subject; more
definitely, but variously. Some assigned bodies to the angels, others
not; a difference which, however, is only apparent, since the angelic
body is only a phantasmal one. But concerning the human body of the
resurrection, they had not only different, but even opposite,
conceptions; indeed, these contradictions lay in the nature of the
case, necessarily resulted from the fundamental contradiction of the
religious consciousness which, as we have shown, exhibits itself in the
incompatible propositions that the body which is raised is the same
individual body which we had before the resurrection, and that
nevertheless it is another. It is the same body even to the hair,
&ldquo;<span lang="la">cum nec periturus sit capillus, ut ait Dominus:
Capillus de capite vestro non peribit.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Augustinus
und Petrus, L. l. iv. dist. 44, c. 1. Nevertheless it is the same in
such a way that everything burdensome, everything contradictory to
transcendental feeling, is removed. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Immo sicut
dicit Augustinus: Detrahentur vitia et remanebit natura.
<i>Superexcrescentia autem capillorum et unguium est de superfluitate
et vitio naturae. Si enim non peccasset homo, crescerent ungues et
capilli ejus usque ad determinatam quantitatem</i>, sicut in leonibus
et avibus.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(<span lang="la">Addit. Henrici ab
Vurimaria, ibid. edit. Basiliae, 1513.</span>) What a specific,
na&iuml;ve, ingenuous, confident, harmonious faith! The risen body, as
the same and yet another, a new body, has hair and nails, otherwise it
would be a maimed body, deprived of an essential ornament, and
consequently the resurrection would not be a <i lang="la">restitutio in
integrum</i>; moreover they are the same hair and nails as before, but
yet so modified that they are in accordance with the body. Why do not
the believing theologians of modern times enter into such specialities
as occupied the older theologians? Because their faith is itself only
general, indefinite, <i>i.e.</i>, a faith which they only suppose
themselves to possess; because, from fear of their understanding, which
has long been at issue with their faith, from fear of risking their
feeble faith by bringing it to the light, that is, considering it in
detail, they suppress the consequences, the necessary determinations of
their faith, and conceal them from their understanding.</p>

<p class="first"><i>What faith denies on earth it affirms in heaven;
what it renounces here it recovers a hundred-fold there.</i> In this
world, faith occupies itself with nullifying the body; in the other
world, with establishing it. Here the main point is the separation of
the soul from the body, there the main point is the reunion of the body
with the soul. &ldquo;I would live not only according to the soul, but
according to the body also. I would have the <i>corpus</i> with me; I
would that the body should return to the soul and be united with
it.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. vii. p. 90). In that which is sensuous,
Christ is supersensuous; but for that reason, in the supersensuous he
is sensuous. Heavenly bliss is therefore by no means merely spiritual,
it is equally corporeal, sensuous&mdash;a state in which all wishes are
fulfilled. &ldquo;Whatever thy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317"
href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>heart seeks joy and pleasure
in, that shall be there in abundance. For it is said, God shall be all
in all. And where God is, there must be all good things that can ever
be desired.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dost thou desire to see acutely, and to hear
through walls, and to be so light that thou mayst be wherever thou wilt
in a moment, whether here below on the earth, or above in the clouds,
that shall all be, and what more thou canst conceive, which thou
couldst have in body and soul, thou shalt have abundantly if thou hast
him.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. x. pp. 380, 381). Certainly eating,
drinking, and marriage find no place in the Christian heaven, as they
do in the Mohammedan; but only because with these enjoyments want is
associated, and with want matter, <i>i.e.</i>, passion, dependence,
unhappiness. &ldquo;Illic ipsa indigentia morietur. Tunc vere dives
eris, quando nullius indigens eris.&rdquo;&mdash;Augustin. (Serm. ad
Pop. p. 77, c. 9). The pleasures of this earth are only medicines, says
the same writer; true health exists only in immortal
life&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="la">vera sanitas, nisi quando vera
immortalitas.</span>&rdquo; The heavenly life, the heavenly body, is as
free and unlimited as wishes, as omnipotent as imagination.
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Futurae ergo resurrectionis corpus imperfectae
felicitatis erit, si cibos sumere <i>non potuerit</i>, imperfectae
felicitatis, si cibus <i>eguerit</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Augustin.
(Epist. 102, &sect; 6, edit. cit). Nevertheless, existence in a body
without fatigue, without heaviness, without disagreeables, without
disease, without mortality, is associated with the highest corporeal
well-being. Even the knowledge of God in heaven is free from any effort
of thought or faith, is sensational, immediate
knowledge&mdash;intuition. The Christians are indeed not agreed whether
God, as God, the <i>essentia Dei</i>, will be visible to bodily eyes.
(See, for example, Augustin. Serm. ad Pop. p. 277, and Buddeus, Comp.
Inst. Th. l. ii. c. 3, &sect; 4.) But in this difference we again have
only the contradiction between the abstract and the real God; the
former is certainly not an object of vision, but the latter is so.
&ldquo;Flesh and blood is the wall between me and Christ, which will be
torn away.... There everything will be certain. For in that life the
eyes will see, the mouth taste, and the nose smell it; the treasure
will shine into the soul and life.... Faith will cease, and I shall
behold with my eyes.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. ix. p. 595). It is clear
from this again, that God, as he is an object of religious sentiment,
is nothing else than a product of the imagination. The heavenly beings
are supersensuous sensuous, immaterial material beings, <i>i.e.</i>,
beings of the imagination; but they are like God, nay, identical with
God, consequently God also is a supersensuous sensuous, an immaterial
material being.</p>

<p class="first"><i>The contradiction in the Sacraments is the

the natural qualities of water are pronounced essential to Baptism.

<i>verbum</i> et <i>elementum</i>.... Non ergo <i>in alio liquore</i>
potest consecrari baptismus <i>nisi in aqua</i>.&mdash;Petrus Lomb. (l.
iv. dist. 3, c. l. c. 5). Ad certitudinem baptismi requiritur major
quam <i>unius guttae</i> quantitas.... Necesse est ad valorem baptismi
fieri <i>contactum physicum</i> inter aquam et corpus baptizati, ita ut

pectus et <i>praesertim caput</i>.&mdash;Theolog. Schol. (P. Mezger.
Aug. Vind. 1695, Th. iv. pp. 230, 231). <i>Aquam, eamque veram</i> ac
<i>naturalem</i> in baptismo adhibendam esse<span class="corr" id=

vero et Apostolorum Act. viii. 36, x. 47, patet.&mdash;F. Buddeus (Com.
Inst. Th. dog. l. iv. c. i. &sect; 5).</span>&rdquo; Thus water is
essential. But now comes the <i>negation</i> of the natural qualities
of water. The significance of Baptism is not the natural power of
water, but the supernatural, almighty power of the Word of God, who
instituted the use of water as a sacrament, and now by means of this
element imparts himself to man in a supernatural, miraculous manner,
but who could just as well have chosen any other element in order to
produce the same effect. So Luther, for example, says:
&ldquo;Understand the distinction, that Baptism is quite another thing
than all other water, not on account of its natural quality, but
because here something more noble is added. For God himself brings
hither his glory, power, and might ... as St. Augustine also hath
taught: &lsquo;<span lang="la">accedat verbum ad elementum et fit
sacramentum.</span>&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Baptize them in the name of
the Father, &amp;c. Water without these words is mere water.... Who
will call the baptism of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost mere water? Do
we not see what sort of spice God puts into this water? When sugar is
thrown into water it is no longer water, but a costly claret or other
beverage. Why then do we here separate the word from the water and say,
it is mere water; as if the word of God, yea, God himself, were not
with and in the water.... Therefore, the water of Baptism is such a
water as takes away sin, death, and unhappiness, helps us in heaven and
to everlasting life. It is become a precious sugared water, <i lang=
"la">aromaticum</i>, and restorative, since God has mingled himself
therewith.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. p. 105).</p>
<p>As with the water in Baptism, which sacrament is nothing without
water, though this water is nevertheless in itself indifferent, so is
it with the wine and bread in the Eucharist, even in Catholicism, where
the substance of bread and wine is destroyed by the power of the
Almighty. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Accidentia eucharistica tamdiu
continent Christum, quamdiu retinent illud temperamentum, cum quo
connaturaliter panis et vini substantia permaneret: ut econtra, quando
tanta fit temperamenti dissolutio, illorumque corruptio, ut sub iis
substantia panis et vini naturaliter remanere non posset, desinunt
continere Christum.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Theol. Schol. (Mezger. l. c. p.
292). That is to say: so long as the bread remains bread, so long does
the bread remain flesh; when the bread is gone, the flesh is gone.
Therefore a due portion of bread, at least enough to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>render bread recognisable as such, must be
present, for consecration to be possible.&mdash;(Ib. p. 284.) For the
rest, Catholic transubstantiation, the <i lang="la">conversio realis et
physica totius panis in corpus Christi</i>, is only a consistent
continuation of the miracles of the Old and New Testaments. By the
transformation of water into wine, of a staff into a serpent, of stones
into brooks (<a class="biblink xd21e48" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%20114">Ps. cxiv</a>.)
by these biblical transubstantiations the Catholics explained and
proved the turning of bread into flesh. He who does not stumble at
those transformations, has no right, no reason to hesitate at accepting
this. The Protestant doctrine of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is not less in
contradiction with reason than the Catholic. &ldquo;The body of Christ
cannot be partaken otherwise than in two ways, spiritually or bodily.
Again, this bodily partaking cannot be visible or perceptible,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, is not bodily, &ldquo;else no bread would remain. Again,
it cannot be mere bread; otherwise it would not be a bodily communion
of the body of Christ, but of bread. Therefore the bread broken must
also be truly and corporeally the body of Christ, although
invisibly&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, incorporeally).&mdash;Luther (Th. xix.
p. 203). The difference is, that the Protestant gives no explanation
concerning the <i>mode</i> in which bread can be flesh and wine blood.
&ldquo;Thereupon we stand, believe, and teach, that the body of Christ
is truly and corporeally taken and eaten in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
But how this takes place, or how he is in the bread, we know not, and
are not bound to know.&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (ut sup. p. 393). &ldquo;He who
will be a Christian must not ask, as our fanatics and factionaries do,
how it can be that bread is the body of Christ and wine the blood of
Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (Th. xvi. p. 220). &ldquo;<span lang="la">Cum
retineamus doctrinam de praesentia corporis Christi, quid opus est
quaerere de modo?</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Melancthon (Vita Mel. Camerarius,
ed. Strobel, Halae, 1777, p. 446). Hence the Protestants as well as the
Catholics took refuge in Omnipotence, the grand source of ideas
contradictory to reason.&mdash;(Concord. Summ. Beg. Art. 7, Aff. 3,
Negat. 13. See also Luther, <i>e.g.</i>, Th. xix. p. 400.)</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>An instructive example of theological incomprehensibleness and
supernaturalness is afforded by the distinction, in relation to the
Eucharist (<span lang="de">Concordienb. Summ. Beg. art. 7</span>),
between partaking with the mouth and partaking in a fleshly or natural
manner. &ldquo;We believe, teach, and confess that the body of Christ
is taken in the bread and wine, not alone spiritually by faith, but
also with the mouth, yet not in a Capernaitic, but a supernatural
heavenly manner, for the sake of sacramental union.&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Dogma and Morality, Faith and Love, contradict each
other in Christianity.</i> It is true that God, the object of faith, is
in himself the idea of the species in a mystical garb&mdash;the common
Father of men&mdash;and so far love to God is mystical love to man. But
God is not only the universal being; he is also a peculiar, personal
being, distinguished from love. Where the being is distinguished from
love arises <i>arbitrariness</i>. Love acts from necessity, personality
from will. Personality proves itself as such only by arbitrariness;
personality seeks dominion, is greedy of glory; it desires only to
assert itself, to enforce its own authority. The highest worship of God
as a <i>personal</i> being is therefore the worship of God as an
absolutely unlimited, arbitrary being. Personality, as such, is
indifferent to all substantial determinations which lie in the nature
of things; inherent necessity, the coercion of natural qualities,
appears to it a constraint. Here we have the mystery of Christian love.
The love of God, as the predicate of a personal being, has here the
significance of grace, favour: God is a gracious master, as in Judaism
he was a severe master. Grace is arbitrary love,&mdash;love which does
not act from an inward necessity of the nature, but which is equally
capable of <i>not</i> doing what it does, which could, if it would,
condemn its object; thus it is a groundless, unessential, arbitrary,
absolutely subjective, merely personal love. &ldquo;He hath mercy on
whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth (<a class=
"biblink xd21e48" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%209:18">Rom. ix.
18</a>).... The king does what he will. So is it with the will of God.
He has perfect right and full power to do with us and all creatures as
he will. And no wrong is done to us. If his will had a measure or rule,
a law, ground, or cause, it would not be the divine will. For what he
wills is right, because he wills it. Where there is faith and the Holy
Spirit ... it is believed that God would be good and kind even if he
consigned all men to damnation. &lsquo;Is not Esau Jacob&rsquo;s
brother? said the Lord. Yet I have loved Jacob and hated
Esau.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xix. pp. 83, 87, 90, 91, 97).
Where love is understood in this sense, jealous watch is kept that man
attribute nothing to himself as merit, that the merit may lie with the
divine personality alone; there every idea of necessity is carefully
dismissed, in order, through the feeling of obligation and gratitude,
to be able to adore and glorify the personality exclusively. The Jews
deified the pride of ancestry; the Christians, on the other hand,
interpreted and transformed the Jewish aristocratic principle of
hereditary nobility into the democratic principle of nobility of merit.
The Jew makes salvation depend on birth, the Catholic on the merit of
works, the Protestant on the merit of faith. But the idea of obligation
and meritoriousness allies itself only with a deed, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>a
work, which cannot be demanded of me, or which does not necessarily
proceed from my nature. The works of the poet, of the philosopher, can
be regarded in the light of merit only as considered externally. They
are works of genius&mdash;inevitable products: the poet <i>must</i>
bring forth poetry, the philosopher <i>must</i> philosophise. They have
the highest satisfaction in the activity of creation, apart from any
collateral or ulterior purpose. And it is just so with a truly noble
moral action. To the man of noble feeling, the noble action is natural:
he does not hesitate whether he should do it or not, he does not place
it in the scales of choice; he <i>must</i> do it. Only he who so acts
is a man to be confided in. Meritoriousness always involves the notion
that a thing is done, so to speak, out of luxury, not out of necessity.
The Christians indeed celebrated the highest act in their religion, the
act of God becoming man, as a work of love. But Christian love in so
far as it reposes on faith, on the idea of God as a master, a
<i>Dominus</i>, has the significance of an act of grace, of a love in
itself superfluous. A gracious master is one who foregoes his rights, a
master who does out of graciousness what, as a master, he is not bound
to do&mdash;what goes beyond the strict idea of a master. To God, as a
master, it is not even a duty to do good to man; he has even the
right&mdash;for he is a master bound by no law&mdash;to annihilate man
if he will. In fact, mercy is optional, non-necessary love, love in
contradiction with the essence of love, love which is not an inevitable
manifestation of the nature, love which the master, the subject, the
person (personality is only an abstract, modern expression for
sovereignty) distinguishes from himself as a predicate which he can
either have or not have without ceasing to be himself. This internal
contradiction necessarily manifested itself in the life, in the
practice of Christianity; it gave rise to the practical separation of
the subject from the predicate, of faith from love. As the love of God
to man was only an act of grace, so also the love of man to man was
only an act of favour or grace on the part of faith. Christian love is
the graciousness of faith, as the love of God is the graciousness of
personality or supremacy. (On the divine arbitrariness, see also J. A.
Ernesti&rsquo;s treatise previously cited: &ldquo;Vindici&aelig;
arbitrii divini.&rdquo;)</p>
<p><i>Faith has within it a malignant principle.</i> Christian faith,
and nothing else, is the ultimate ground of Christian persecution and
destruction of heretics. Faith recognises man only on condition that he
recognises God, <i>i.e.</i>, faith itself. Faith is the honour which
man renders to God. And this honour is due unconditionally. To faith
the basis of all duties is faith in God: faith is the absolute duty;
duties to men are only derivative, subordinate. The unbeliever is thus
an outlaw<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7512src" href="#xd21e7512" name=
"xd21e7512src">4</a>&mdash;a man worthy of extermination. That which
denies God must be itself denied. The highest crime is the crime
<i lang="la">laesae majestatis Dei</i>. To faith God is a personal
being&mdash;the supremely personal, inviolable, privileged being. The
acme of personality is honour; hence an injury towards the highest
personality <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>is necessarily the highest crime. The
<i>honour</i> of God cannot be disavowed as an accidental, rude,
anthropomorphic conception. For is not the personality, even the
existence of God, a sensuous, anthropomorphic conception? Let those who
renounce the honour be consistent enough to renounce the personality.
From the idea of personality results the idea of honour, and from this
again the idea of religious offences. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Quicunque

crimen est, injuriosum quempiam Deo esse</i>? Semper enim per
dignitatem injuriam perferentis crescit culpa facientis, quia necesse
est, quanto major est persona ejus qui contumeliam patitur, tanto major
sit noxa ejus, qui facit.</span>&rdquo; Thus speaks Salvianus (de
Gubernat. Dei, l. vi. p. 218, edit. cit.)&mdash;Salvianus, who is
called <i lang="la">Magistrum Episcoporum, sui saeculi Jeremiam,
Scriptorem Christianissimum, Orbis christiani magistrum</i>. But
heresy, unbelief in general&mdash;heresy is only a definite, limited
unbelief&mdash;is blasphemy, and thus is the highest, the most
flagitious crime. Thus to cite only one among innumerable examples, J.
Oecolampadius writes to Servetus: &ldquo;<span lang="la">Dum non summam
patientiam prae me fero, dolens Jesum Christum filium Dei sic
dehonestari, parum christiane tibi agere videor. In aliis mansuetus
ero: in <i>blasphemiis</i> quae in Christum, non
item.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(<span lang="la">Historia Mich. Serveti. H.
ab Allwoerden Helmstadii, 1737</span>, p. 13). For what is blasphemy?
Every negation of an idea, of a definition, in which the honour of God,
the honour of faith is concerned. Servetus fell as a sacrifice to
Christian faith. Calvin said to Servetus two hours before his death:
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Ego vero ingenue praefatus, me nunquam
<i>privatus injurias</i> fuisse persecutum,</span>&rdquo; and parted
from him with a sense of being thoroughly sustained by the Bible:
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Ab haeretico homine, qui <span class="trans"
title="autokatakritos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&alpha;&#8016;&tau;&omicron;&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8049;&kappa;&rho;&iota;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>
peccabat, <i>secundum Pauli praeceptum</i>
discessi.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Ibid. p. 120.) Thus it was by no means a
<i>personal hatred</i>, though this may have been conjoined,&mdash;it
was a <i>religious hatred</i> which brought Servetus to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>the
stake&mdash;the hatred which springs from the nature of unchecked
faith. Even Melancthon is known to have approved the execution of
Servetus. The Swiss theologians, whose opinion was asked by the
Genevans, very subtilely abstained, in their answer, from mentioning
the punishment of death,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7614src" href=
"#xd21e7614" name="xd21e7614src">5</a> but agreed with the Genevans in
this&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="la">Horrendos Serveti errores detestandos
esse, severiusque idcirco in Servetum animadvertendum.</span>&rdquo;
Thus there is no difference as to the principle, only as to the mode of
punishment. Even Calvin himself was so <i>Christian</i> as to desire to
alleviate the horrible mode of death to which the Senate of Geneva
condemned Servetus. (See on this subject, <i>e.g.</i>, M.
Adami<span class="corr" id="xd21e7630" title="Not in source">,</span>
Vita Calvini, p. 90; Vita Bezae, p. 207; Vitae Theol. Exter. Francof.
1618.) We have, therefore, to consider this execution as an act of
general significance&mdash;as a work of faith, and that not of Roman
Catholic, but of reformed, biblical, evangelical faith. That heretics
must not be compelled to a profession of the faith by force was
certainly maintained by most of the lights of the Church, but there
nevertheless lived in them the most malignant hatred of heretics. Thus,
for example, St. Bernard says (Super Cantica, &sect; 66) in relation to
heretics: &ldquo;<span lang="la">Fides suadenda est, non
imponenda,</span>&rdquo; but he immediately adds: &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Quamquam melius procul dubio gladio coercerentur, illius
videlicet, qui non sine causa gladium portat, quam in suum errorem
multos trajicere permittantur.</span>&rdquo; If the faith of the
present day no longer produces such flagrant deeds of horror, this is
due only to the fact that the faith of this age is not an
uncompromising, living faith, but a sceptical, eclectic, unbelieving
faith, curtailed and maimed by the power of art and science. Where
heretics are no longer burned either in the fires of this world or of
the other, there faith itself has no longer any fire, any vitality. The
faith which allows variety of belief renounces its divine origin and
rank, degrades itself to a subjective opinion. <i>It is not to
Christian faith, not to Christian love</i> (i.e., <i>love limited by
faith); no! it is to doubt of Christian faith, to the victory of
religious scepticism, to free-thinkers, to heretics, that we owe
tolerance, freedom of opinion</i>. It was the heretics, persecuted by
the Christian Church, who alone fought for freedom of conscience.
Christian freedom is freedom in non-essentials only: on the fundamental
articles of faith freedom is not allowed. When, however, Christian
faith&mdash;faith considered in distinction from love, for faith is not
one with love, &ldquo;potestis habere fidem sine caritate&rdquo;
(Augustinus, Serm. ad Pop. &sect; 90)&mdash;is pronounced to be the
principle, the ultimate ground of the violent deeds of Christians
towards heretics (that is, such deeds as arose from real believing
zeal), it is obviously not meant that faith could have these
consequences immediately and originally, but only in its historical
development. Still, even to the earliest Christians the heretic was an
antichrist, and necessarily so&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="la">adversus
Christum sunt haeretici</span>&rdquo; (Cyprianus, Epist. 76, &sect; 14,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>edit.
cit.)&mdash;accursed&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="la">apostoli ... in
epistolis haereticos exsecrati sunt</span>&rdquo; (Cyprianus, ib.
&sect; 6)&mdash;a lost being, doomed by God to hell and everlasting
death. &ldquo;Thou hearest that the tares are already condemned and
sentenced to the fire. Why then wilt thou lay many sufferings on a
heretic? Dost thou not hear that he is already judged to a punishment
heavier than he can bear? Who art thou, that thou wilt interfere and
punish him who has already fallen under the punishment of a more
powerful master? What would I do against a thief already sentenced to
the gallows?... God has already commanded his angels, who in his own
time will be the executioners of heretics.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th.
xvi. p. 132). When therefore the State, the world, became Christian,
and also, for that reason, Christianity became worldly, the Christian
religion a State religion; then it was a necessary consequence that the
condemnation of heretics, which was at first only religious or
dogmatic, became a political, practical condemnation, and the eternal
punishment of hell was anticipated by temporal punishment. If,
therefore, the definition and treatment of heresy as a punishable crime
is in contradiction with the Christian faith, it follows that a
Christian king, a Christian State, is in contradiction with it; for a
Christian State is that which executes the Divine judgments of faith
with the sword, which makes earth a heaven to believers, a hell to
unbelievers. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Docuimus ... pertinere ad <i>reges
religiosos</i>, non solum adulteria vel homicidia vel hujusmodi alia
flagitia seu facinora, verum etiam <i>sacrilegia severitate congrua
cohibere</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Augustinus (Epist. ad Dulcitium).
&ldquo;Kings ought thus to serve the Lord Christ by helping with laws
that his honour be furthered. Now when the temporal magistracy finds
scandalous errors, whereby the honour of the Lord Christ is blasphemed
and men&rsquo;s salvation hindered, and a schism arises among the
people ... where such false teachers will not be admonished and cease
from preaching, there ought the temporal magistracy confidently to arm
itself, and know that nothing else befits its office but to apply the
sword and all force, that doctrine may be pure and God&rsquo;s service
genuine and unperverted, and also that peace and unity may be
preserved.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xv. pp. 110, 111). Let it be
further remarked here, that Augustine justifies the application of
coercive measures for the awaking of Christian faith by urging that the
Apostle Paul was converted to Christianity by a deed of force&mdash;a
miracle. (De Correct. Donat. c. 6.) The intrinsic connection between
temporal and eternal, <i>i.e.</i>, political and spiritual punishment,
is clear from this, that the same reasons which have been urged against
the temporal punishment of heresy are equally valid against the
punishment of hell. If heresy or unbelief cannot be punished
<i>here</i> because it is a mere mistake, neither can it be punished by
God in hell. If coercion is in contradiction with the nature of faith,
so is hell; for the fear of the terrible consequence of unbelief, the
torments of hell, urge to belief against knowledge and will. Boehmer,
in his <i>Jus. Eccl.</i>, argues that heresy and unbelief should be
struck out of the category of crimes, that unbelief is only a <i>vitium
theologicum</i>, a <i>peccatum in Deum</i>. But God, in the view of
faith, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>is not only a religious, but a political,
juridical being, the King of kings, the true head of the State.
&ldquo;There is no power but of God ... it is the minister of
God&rdquo;&mdash;<a class="biblink xd21e48" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%2013:1-4">Rom. xiii.
1, 4</a>. If, therefore, the juridical idea of majesty, of kingly
dignity and honour, applies to God, sin against God, unbelief, must by
consequence come under the definition of crime. And as with God, so
with faith. Where faith is still a truth, and a public truth, there no
doubt is entertained that it can be demanded of every one, that every
one is bound to believe. Be it further observed, that the Christian
Church has gone so far in its hatred against heretics, that according
to the canon law even the suspicion of heresy is a crime,
&ldquo;<span lang="la">ita ut de jure canonico revera <i>crimen
suspecti</i> detur, cujus <i>existentiam frustra in jure civili
quaerimus</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Boehmer (l. c. v. Tit. vii.
&sect;&sect; 23&ndash;42).</p>
<p><i>The command to love enemies extends only to personal enemies, not
to the enemies of God, the enemies of faith.</i> &ldquo;Does not the
Lord Christ command that we should love even our enemies? How then does
David here boast that he hates the assembly of the wicked, and sits not
with the ungodly?... For the sake of the person I should love them; but
for the sake of the doctrine I should hate them. And thus I must hate
them or hate God, who commands and wills that we should cleave to his
word alone.... What I cannot love with God, I must hate; if they only
preach something which is against God, all love and friendship is
destroyed;&mdash;thereupon I hate thee, and do thee no good. For faith
must be uppermost, and where the word of God is attacked, hate takes
the place of love.... And so David means to say: I hate them, not
because they have done injury and evil to me and led a bad and wicked
life, but because they despise, revile, blaspheme, falsify, and
persecute the word of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Faith and love are two things.
Faith endures nothing, love endures all things. Faith curses, love
blesses: faith seeks vengeance and punishment, love seeks forbearance
and forgiveness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Rather than God&rsquo;s word should fall
and heresy stand, faith would wish all creatures to be destroyed; for
through heresy men lose God himself.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. vi. p.
94; Th. v. pp. 624, 630). See also, on this subject, my treatise in the
<i lang="de">Deutsches Jahrb.</i> and Augustini Enarrat. in <a class=
"biblink xd21e48" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%20138">Psalm
cxxxviii</a>. (cxxxix.). As Luther distinguishes the <i>person</i> from
the enemy of God, so Augustine here distinguishes the <i>man</i> from
the enemy of God, from the unbeliever, and says: We should hate the
ungodliness in the man, but love the humanity in him. But what, then,
in the eyes of faith, is the man in distinction from faith, man without
faith, <i>i.e.</i>, without God? Nothing: for the sum of all realities,
of all that is worthy of love, of all that is good and essential, is
faith, as that which alone apprehends and possesses God. It is true
that man as man is the image of God, but only of the natural God, of
God as the Creator of Nature. But the Creator is only God as he
manifests himself outwardly; the true God, God as he is in himself, the
inward essence of God, is the <i>triune</i> God, is especially
<i>Christ</i>. (See Luther, Th. xiv. pp. 2, 3, and Th. xvi. p. 581.)
And the image of this true, essential, Christian God, is only the
believer, the Christian. Moreover, man is not to be loved for his own
sake, but for God&rsquo;s. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href=

the true God, be an object of love?</p>

And this separation is by no means unbiblical. On the contrary, we find
that, in support of it, the Fathers appeal directly to the Bible. The

heathens and Christians relates only to marriages which had taken place
before conversion, not to those which were yet to be contracted. Let
the reader refer to what Peter Lombard says in the book already cited.
&ldquo;The first Christians did not acknowledge, did not once listen
to, all those relatives who sought to turn them away from the hope of
the heavenly reward. This they did through the power of the Gospel, for
the sake of which all love of kindred was to be despised; inasmuch as

<p><i>Faith has the significance of religion, love only that of
morality.</i> This has been declared very decidedly by Protestantism.
The doctrine that love does not justify in the sight of God, but only
faith, expresses nothing further than that love has no religious power
and significance. (Apol. Augsb. Confess. art. 3. Of Love and the
Fulfilment of the Law.) It is certainly here said: &ldquo;What the
scholastic writers teach concerning the love of God is a dream, and it
is impossible to know and love God before we know and lay hold on mercy
through faith. For then first does God become <i lang="la">objectum
amabile</i>, a lovable, blissful object of contemplation.&rdquo; Thus
here mercy, love is made the proper object of faith. And it is true
that faith is immediately distinguished from love only in this, that
faith places out of itself what love places in itself. &ldquo;We
believe that our justification, salvation, and consolation, lie out of
ourselves.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. p. 497; see also Th. ix. p.
587). It is true that faith in the Protestant sense is faith in the
forgiveness of sins, faith in mercy, faith in Christ, as the God who
suffered and died for men, so that man, in order to attain everlasting
salvation, has nothing further to do on his side than believingly to
accept this sacrifice of God for him. But it is not as love only that
God is an object of faith. On the contrary, the characteristic object
of faith <i>as faith</i> is God as a subject, a person. And is a God
who accords no merit to man, who claims all exclusively for himself,
who watches jealously over his honour&mdash;is a self-interested,
egoistic God like this a God of love?</p>
<p><i>The morality which proceeds from faith has for its principle and
criterion only the contradiction of Nature, of man.</i> As the highest
object of faith is that which most contradicts reason, the Eucharist,
so necessarily the highest virtue of the morality which is true and
obedient to faith is that which most contradicts Nature.
<i>Dogmatic</i> miracles have therefore <i>moral</i> miracles as their
<i>consequence</i>. Antinatural morality is the twin sister of
supernatural faith. As faith vanquishes Nature outside of man, so the
morality of faith vanquishes Nature within man. This practical
supernaturalism, the summit of which is &ldquo;virginity, the sister of
the angels, the queen of virtues, the mother of all good&rdquo; (see A.
v. Buchers: Geistliches Suchverloren. (S&auml;mmtl. W. B. vi. 151), has
been specially developed by Catholicism; for Protestantism has held
fast only the principle of Christianity, and has arbitrarily eliminated
its logical consequences; it has embraced only Christian faith and not
Christian morality. In faith, Protestantism has brought man back to the
standpoint of primitive Christianity; but in life, in practice, in
morality, it has restored him to the pre-Christian, the Old Testament,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>the heathen, Adamitic, natural standpoint. God
instituted marriage in paradise; therefore even in the present day,
even to Christians, the command Multiply! is valid. Christ advises
those only not to marry who &ldquo;can receive&rdquo; this higher rule.
Chastity is a supernatural gift; it cannot therefore be expected of
every one. But is not faith also a supernatural gift, a special gift of
God, a miracle, as Luther says innumerable times, and is it not
nevertheless commanded to us all? Are not all men included in the
command to mortify, blind, and contemn the natural reason? Is not the
tendency to believe and accept nothing which contradicts reason as
natural, as strong, as necessary in us, as the sexual impulse? If we
ought to pray to God for faith because by ourselves we are too weak to
believe, why should we not on the same ground entreat God for chastity?
Will he deny us this gift if we earnestly implore him for it? Never!
Thus we may regard chastity as a universal command equally with faith,
for what we cannot do of ourselves, we can do through God. What speaks
against chastity speaks against faith also, and what speaks for faith
speaks for chastity. One stands and falls with the other; with a
supernatural faith is necessarily associated a supernatural morality.
Protestantism tore this bond asunder: in faith it affirmed
Christianity; in life, in practice, it denied Christianity,
acknowledged the autonomy of natural reason, of man,&mdash;restored man
to his original rights. Protestantism rejected celibacy, chastity, not
because it contradicted the Bible, but because it contradicts man and
nature. &ldquo;He who will be single renounces the name of man, and
proves or makes himself an angel or spirit.... It is pitiable folly to
wonder that a man takes a wife, or for any one to be ashamed of doing
so, since no one wonders that men are accustomed to eat and
drink.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xix. pp. 368, 369). Does this unbelief
as to the possibility and reality of chastity accord with the Bible,
where celibacy is eulogised as a laudable, and consequently a possible,
attainable state? No! It is in direct contradiction with the Bible.
Protestantism, in consequence of its practical spirit, and therefore by
its own inherent force, repudiated Christian supranaturalism in the
sphere of morality. Christianity exists for it only in faith&mdash;not
in law, not in morality, not in the State. It is true that love (the
compendium of morality) belongs essentially to the Christian, so that
where there is no love, where faith does not attest itself by love,
there is no faith, no Christianity. Nevertheless love is only the
outward manifestation of faith, only a consequence, and only human.
&ldquo;Faith alone deals with God,&rdquo; &ldquo;faith makes us
gods;&rdquo; love makes us merely men, and as faith alone is for God,
so God is for faith alone, <i>i.e.</i>, faith alone is the divine, the
Christian in man. To faith belongs eternal life, to love only this
temporal life. &ldquo;Long before Christ came God gave this temporal,
earthly life to the whole world, and said that man should love him and
his neighbour. After that he gave the world to his Son Christ, that we
through and by him should have eternal life.... Moses and the law
belong to this life, but for the other life we must have the
Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. p. 459). Thus although love belongs
to the Christian, yet is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href=
"#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>Christian a Christian only through
this, that he believes in Christ. It is true that to serve one&rsquo;s
neighbour, in whatever way, rank, or calling, is to serve God. But the
God whom I serve in fulfilling a worldly or natural office is only the
universal, mundane, natural, pre-Christian God. Government, the State,
marriage, existed prior to Christianity, was an institution, an
ordinance of God, in which he did not as yet reveal himself as the true
God, as Christ. Christ has nothing to do with all these worldly things;
they are external, indifferent to him. But for this very reason, every
worldly calling and rank is compatible with Christianity; for the true,
Christian service of God is faith alone, and this can be exercised
everywhere. Protestantism binds men only in faith, all the rest it
leaves free, but only because all the rest is external to faith.</p>
<p>It is true that we are bound by the commandments of Christian
morality, as, for example, &ldquo;Avenge not yourselves,&rdquo;
&amp;c., but they have validity for us only as private, not as public
persons. The world is governed according to its own laws. Catholicism
&ldquo;mingled together the worldly and spiritual kingdoms,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, it sought to govern the world by Christianity. But
&ldquo;Christ did not come on earth to interfere in the government of
the Emperor Augustus and teach him how to reign.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther
(Th. xvi. p. 49). Where worldly government begins Christianity ends;
there worldly justice, the sword, war, litigation, prevail. As a
Christian I let my cloak be stolen from me without resistance, but as a
citizen I seek to recover it by law. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Evangelium
non abolet jus natur&aelig;.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Melancthon (de
Vindicta Loci. See also on this subject M. Chemnitii Loci Theol. de
Vindicta). In fact, Protestantism is the practical negation of
Christianity, the practical assertion of the natural man. It is true
that Protestantism also commands the mortifying of the flesh, the
negation of the natural man; but apart from the fact that this negation
has for Protestantism no religious significance and efficacy, does not
justify, <i>i.e.</i>, make acceptable to God, procure salvation; the
negation of the flesh in Protestantism is not distinguished from that
limitation of the flesh which natural reason and morality enjoin on
man. The necessary practical consequences of the Christian faith
Protestantism has relegated to the other world, to heaven&mdash;in
other words, has denied them. la heaven first ceases the worldly
standpoint of Protestantism; there we no longer marry, there first we
are new creatures; but here everything remains as of old &ldquo;until
that life; there the external life will be changed, for Christ did not
come to change the creature.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xv. p. 62). Here
we are half heathens, half Christians; half citizens of the earth, half
citizens of heaven. Of this division, this disunity, this chasm,
Catholicism knows nothing. What it denies in heaven, <i>i.e.</i>, in
faith, it denies, also, as far as possible, on earth, <i>i.e.</i>, in
morality. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Grandis igitur virtutis est et

Catholicism, that morality which the saints attested by their lives,
and which was sanctioned even by the Head of the Church, otherwise so
worldly. Thus it is said, for example, in the <span lang=
"la">Canonizatio S. Bernhardi Abbatis per Alexandrum papam III. anno
Ch. 1164. Litt. apost ... primo ad. Praelatos Eccles. Gallic.</span>:
&ldquo;<span lang="la"><i>In afflictione vero corporis sui</i> usque
adeo sibi mundum, seque mundo reddidit crucifixum, ut confidamus
martyrum quoque eum merita obtinere sanctorum, etc.</span>&rdquo; It
was owing to this purely negative moral principle that there could be
enunciated within Catholicism itself the gross opinion that mere
martyrdom, without the motive of love to God, obtains heavenly
blessedness.</p>
<p>It is true that Catholicism also in practice denied the
supranaturalistic morality of Christianity; but its negation has an
essentially different significance from that of Protestantism; it is a
negation <i>de facto</i> but not <i>de jure</i>. The Catholic denied in
life what he ought to have affirmed in life,&mdash;as, for example, the
vow of chastity,&mdash;what he desired to affirm, at least if he was a
religious Catholic, but which in the nature of things he could not
affirm. Thus he gave validity to the law of Nature, he gratified the
flesh, in a word, he was a man, in contradiction with his essential
character, his religious principle and conscience. <i lang="la">Adhuc
proh dolor! vivit in me verus homo.</i> Catholicism has proved to the
world that the supernatural principle of faith in Christianity, applied
to life, made a principle of morals, has immoral, radically corrupting
consequences. This experience Protestantism made use of, or rather this
experience called forth Protestantism. It made the illegitimate,
practical negation of Christianity&mdash;illegitimate in the sense of
true Catholicism, though not in that of the degenerate Church&mdash;the
law, the <i>norm</i> of life. You <i>cannot</i> in life, at least in
this life, be Christians, peculiar, superhuman beings, therefore ye
ought not to be such. And it legitimised this negation of Christianity
before its still Christian conscience, by Christianity itself,
pronounced it to be Christian;&mdash;no wonder, therefore, that now at
last modern Christianity not only practically but theoretically
represents the total negation of Christianity as Christianity. When,
however, Protestantism is designated as the contradiction, Catholicism
as the unity of faith and practice, it is obvious that in both cases we
refer only to the essence, to the principle.</p>
<p><i>Faith sacrifices man to God.</i> Human sacrifice belongs to the
very idea of religion. Bloody human sacrifices only dramatise this
idea. &ldquo;By faith Abraham offered up Isaac.&rdquo;&mdash;<a class=
"biblink xd21e48" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%2011:17">Heb. xi.
17</a>. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Quanto major Abraham, qui unicum filium
<i>voluntate jugulavit</i>.... Jepte obtulit virginem filiam et idcirco
in enumeratione sanctorum ab Apostolo
ponitur.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Hieronymus (<span lang="la">Epist.
Juliano</span>). On the human sacrifices in the Jewish religion we
refer the reader to the works of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331"
href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>Daumer and Ghillany. In the
Christian religion also it is only blood, the sacrifice of the Son of
Man, which allays God&rsquo;s anger and reconciles him to man.
Therefore a pure, guiltless man must fall a sacrifice. Such blood alone
is precious, such alone has reconciling power. And this blood, shed on
the cross for the allaying of the divine anger, Christians partake in
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, for the strengthening and sealing of their
faith. But why is the blood taken under the form of wine, the flesh
under the form of bread? That it may not <i>appear</i> as if Christians
ate real human flesh and drank human blood, that the natural man may
not shrink from the mysteries of the Christian faith.
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Etenim ne humana infirmitas esum carnis et potum
sanguinis in sumptione <i>horreret</i>, Christus <i>velari et palliari
illa duo voluit speciebus</i> panis et
vini.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Bernard. (edit. cit. pp. 189&ndash;191).
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Sub alia autem specie tribus de causis carnem et
sanguinem tradit Christus et deinceps sumendum instituit. Ut <i>fides
scil. haberet meritum</i>, quae est de his quae non videntur, quod
<i>fides non habet meritum</i>, ubi humana ratio praebet experimentum.
Et ideo etiam ne <i>abhorreret animus</i> quod cerneret oculus; quod
<i>non habemus in usu carnem crudam comedere et sanguinem
bibere</i>.... Et etiam ideo ne ab <i>incredulis religioni christianae
insultaretur</i>. Unde Augustinus: Nihil rationabilius, quam ut
sanguinis similitudinem sumamus, ut et ita veritas non desit et
<i>ridiculum nullum fiat a paganis, quod</i> cruorem occisi hominis
bibamus.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Petrus Lomb. (<span lang="la">Sent. lib.
iv. dist. ii. c. 4</span>).</p>
<p>But as the bloody human sacrifice, while it expresses the utmost
abnegation of man, is at the same time the highest assertion of his
value;&mdash;for only because human life is regarded as the highest,
because the sacrifice of it is the most painful, costs the greatest
conquest over feeling, is it offered to God;&mdash;so the contradiction
of the Eucharist with human nature is only apparent. Apart from the
fact that flesh and blood are, as St. Bernard says, clothed with bread
and wine, <i>i.e.</i>, that in truth it is not flesh but bread, not
blood but wine, which is partaken,&mdash;the mystery of the Eucharist
resolves itself into the mystery of eating and drinking. &ldquo;All
ancient Christian doctors ... teach that the body of Christ is not
taken spiritually alone by faith, which happens also <i>out of</i> the
Sacraments, but also corporeally; not alone by believers, by the pious,
but also by unworthy, unbelieving, false and wicked Christians.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There are thus two ways of eating Christ&rsquo;s flesh, one
spiritual ... such spiritual eating however is nothing else than
faith.... The other way of eating the body of Christ is to eat it
corporeally or sacramentally.&rdquo;&mdash;(<span lang=
"de">Concordienb. Erkl. art. 7</span>). &ldquo;The mouth eats the body
of Christ bodily.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (against the
&ldquo;fanatics.&rdquo; Th. xix. p. 417). What then forms the specific
difference of the Eucharist? Eating and drinking. Apart from the
Sacrament, God is partaken of spiritually; in the Sacrament he is
partaken of materially, <i>i.e.</i>, he is eaten and drunken,
assimilated by the body. But how couldst thou receive God into thy
body, if it were in thy esteem an organ unworthy of God? Dost thou pour
wine into a water-cask? Dost thou not declare thy hands and lips
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>holy when by means of them thou comest in
contact with the Holy One? Thus if God is eaten and drunken, eating and
drinking is declared to be a divine act; and this is what the Eucharist
expresses, though in a self-contradictory, mystical, covert manner. But
it is our task to express the mystery of religion, openly and
honourably, clearly and definitely. <i>Life is God; the enjoyment of
life is the enjoyment of God; true bliss in life is true religion.</i>
But to the enjoyment of life belongs the enjoyment of eating and
drinking. If therefore life in general is holy, eating and drinking
must be holy. Is this an irreligious creed? Let it be remembered that
this irreligion is the analysed, unfolded, unequivocally expressed
mystery of religion itself. All the mysteries of religion ultimately
resolve themselves, as we have shown, into the mystery of heavenly
bliss. But heavenly bliss is nothing else than happiness freed from the
limits of reality. The Christians have happiness for their object just
as much as the heathens; the only difference is, that the heathens
place heaven on earth, the Christians place earth in heaven. Whatever
<i>is</i>, whatever is really enjoyed, is finite; that which is
<i>not</i>, which is believed in and hoped for, is infinite.</p>

<p class="first"><i>The Christian religion is a contradiction. It is at
once the reconciliation and the disunion, the unity and the opposition,
of God and man. This contradiction is personified in the God-man. The
unity of the Godhead and manhood is at once a truth and an untruth.</i>
We have already maintained that if Christ was God, if he was at once
man and another being conceived as incapable of suffering, his
suffering was an illusion. For his suffering as man was no suffering to
him as God. No! what he acknowledged as man he denied as God. He
suffered only outwardly, not inwardly, <i>i.e.</i>, he suffered only
apparently, not really; for he was man only in appearance, in form, in
the external; in truth, in essence, in which alone he was an object to
the believer, he was God. It would have been true suffering only if he
had suffered as God also. What he did not experience in his nature as
God, he did not experience in truth, in substance. And, incredible as
it is, the Christians themselves half directly, half indirectly, admit
that their highest, holiest mystery is only an illusion, a simulation.
This simulation indeed lies at the foundation of the thoroughly
unhistorical,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8035src" href="#xd21e8035"
name="xd21e8035src">6</a> theatrical, illusory Gospel of John. One
instance, among others, in which this is especially evident, is the
resurrection of Lazarus, where the omnipotent arbiter of life and death
evidently sheds tears only in ostentation of his manhood, and expressly
says: &ldquo;Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me, and I know
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>thou hearest me always, but for the sake of the
people who stand round I said it, that they may believe in thee.&rdquo;
The simulation thus indicated in the Gospel has been developed by the
Church into avowed delusion. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Si credas
susceptionem corporis, adjungas <i>divinitatis compassionem</i>,
portionem utique perfidiae, non perfidiam declinasti. Credis enim, quod

"la">de incarnat. domin. sacr. cc. 4, 5</span>). &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Juxta hominis naturam proficiebat sapientia, non quod ipse
sapientior esset ex tempore ... sed eandem, qua plenus erat, sapientiam
caeteris ex tempore paulatim <i>demonstrabat</i>.... In aliis ergo
<i>non in se</i> proficiebat sapientia et
gratia.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Gregorius in <span lang="la">homil. quadam
(ap. Petrus Lomb. l. iii. dist. 13, c. 1)</span>. &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Proficiebat ergo humanus sensus in eo <i>secundum ostensionem</i>
et <i>aliorum</i> hominum <i>opinionem</i>. Ita enim patrem et matrem
dicitur ignorasse in infantia, quia <i>ita se gerebat et habebat ac si
agnitionis expers esset</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Petrus L. (ibid. c.
2). &ldquo;<span lang="la">Ut homo ergo dubitat, ut homo locutus
est.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Ambrosius. &ldquo;<span lang="la">His verbis
innui videtur, quod Christus non inquantum Deus vel Dei filius, sed
inquantum homo dubitaverit affectu humano. Quod ea ratione dictum
accipi potest: non quod ipse dubitaverit, sed quod <i>modum gessit
dubitantis</i> et hominibus dubitare
videbatur.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Petrus L. (ibid. dist. 17, c. 2). In the
first part of the present work we have exhibited the truth, in the
second part the untruth of religion, or rather of theology. The truth
is only the identity of God and man. Religion is truth only when it
affirms human attributes as divine, falsehood when, in the form of
theology, it denies these attributes, separating God from man as a
different being. Thus, in the first part we had to show the truth of
God&rsquo;s suffering; here we have the proof of its untruth, and not a
proof which lies in our own subjective view, but an objective
proof&mdash;the admission of theology itself, that its highest mystery,
the Passion of God, is only a deception, an illusion. It is therefore
in the highest degree uncritical, untruthful, and arbitrary to explain
the Christian religion, as speculative philosophy has done, only as the
religion of reconciliation between God and man, and not also as the
religion of disunion between the divine and human nature,&mdash;to find
in the God-man only the unity, and not also the contradiction of the
divine and human nature. Christ suffered only as man, not as God.
Capability of suffering is the sign of real humanity. It was not as God
that he was born, that he increased in wisdom, and was crucified;
<i>i.e.</i>, all human conditions remained foreign to him as God.
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Si quis non confitetur proprie et vere
substantialem differentiam naturarum post ineffabilem unionem, ex
quibus unus et solus extitit Christus, in ea salvatum, sit
condemnatus.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Concil. Later. I. can. 7 (Carranza).
The divine nature, notwithstanding the position that Christ was at once
God and man, is just as much dissevered from the human nature in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>incarnation as <i>before</i> it, since each
nature excludes the conditions of the other, although both are united
in one personality, in an incomprehensible, miraculous, <i>i.e.</i>,
untrue manner, in contradiction with the relation in which, according
to their definition, they stand to each other. Even the Lutherans, nay,
Luther himself, however strongly he expresses himself concerning the
community and union of the human and divine nature in Christ, does not
escape from the irreconcilable division between them. &ldquo;God is
man, and man is God, but thereby neither the natures nor their
attributes are confounded, but each nature retains its essence and
attributes.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Son of God himself has truly suffered and
truly died, but according to the human nature which he had assumed; for
the divine nature can neither suffer nor die.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is truly
said, the Son of God suffers. For although the one part (so to speak),
as the Godhead, does not suffer, still the person who is God suffers in
the other half, the manhood; for in truth the Son of God was crucified
for us, that is, the person who is God; for the person is crucified
according to his manhood.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is the person that does and
suffers all, one thing according to this nature, another according to
that nature, all which the learned well know.&rdquo;&mdash;(<span lang=
"de">Concordienb. <span class="corr" id="xd21e8121" title=
"Source: Erklar.">Erkl&auml;r.</span> art. 8.</span>) &ldquo;The Son of
God and God himself is killed and murdered, for God and man is one
person. Therefore God was crucified, and died, and became man; not God
apart from humanity, but united with it; not according to the Godhead,
but according to the human nature which he had
assumed.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. iii. p. 502). Thus only in the
person, <i>i.e.</i>, only in a <i lang="la">nomen proprium</i>, not in
essence, not in truth, are the two natures united. &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Quando dicitur: Deus est homo vel homo est Deus, propositio
ejusmodi vocatur personalis. Ratio est, quia unionem personalem in
Christo supponit. Sine tali enim naturarum in Christo unione nunquam
dicere potuissem, Deum esse hominem aut hominem esse Deum.... Abstracta
autem naturae de se invicem enuntiari non posse, longe est
manifestissimum.... Dicere itaque non licet, divina natura est humana
aut deitas est humanitas et vice versa.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;J. F.
Buddeus (<span lang="la">Comp. Inst. Theol. Dogm. l. iv. c. ii. &sect;
11</span>). Thus the union of the divine and human natures in the
incarnation is only a deception, an illusion. The old dissidence of God
and man lies at the foundation of this dogma also, and operates all the
more injuriously, is all the more odious, that it conceals itself
behind the appearance, the imagination of unity. Hence Socinianism, far
from being superficial when it denied the Trinity and the God-man, was
only consistent, only truthful. God was a triune being, and yet he was
to be held purely simple, absolute unity, an <i lang="la">ens
simplicissimum</i>; thus the Unity contradicted the Trinity. God was
God-man, and yet the Godhead was not to be touched or annulled by the
manhood, <i>i.e.</i>, it was to be essentially distinct; thus the
incompatibility of the divine and human attributes contradicted the
unity of the two natures. According to this, we have in the very idea
of the God-man the arch-enemy of the God-man,&mdash;<i>rationalism</i>,
blended, however, with its opposite&mdash;mysticism. Thus Socinianism
only denied what faith itself denied, and yet, in contradiction
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>with itself, at the same time affirmed; it only
denied a contradiction, an untruth.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Christians have celebrated the incarnation as a
work of love, as a self-renunciation of God, an abnegation of his
majesty&mdash;<i lang="la">Amor triumphat de Deo</i>; for the love of
God is an empty word if it is understood as a real abolition of the
distinction between him and man. Thus we have, in the very central
point of Christianity, the contradiction of Faith and Love developed in
the close of the present work. Faith makes the suffering of God a mere
appearance, love makes it a truth. Only on the truth of the suffering
rests the true positive impression of the incarnation. Strongly, then,
as we have insisted on the contradiction and division between the
divine and the human nature in the God-man, we must equally insist on
their community and unity, in virtue of which God is really man and man
is really God. Here then we have the irrefragable and striking proof
that the central point, the supreme object of Christianity, is nothing
else than <i>man</i>, that Christians adore the human individual as
God, and God as the human individual. &ldquo;This man born of the
Virgin Mary is God himself, who has created heaven and
earth.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. ii. p. 671). &ldquo;I point to the man
Christ and say: That is the Son of God.&rdquo;&mdash;(Th. xix. p. 594.)
&ldquo;To give life, to have all power in heaven and earth, to have all
things in his hands, all things put under his feet, to purify from sin,
and so on, are divine, infinite attributes, which, according to the
declaration of the Holy Scriptures, are given and imparted to the man
Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;Therefore we believe, teach, and confess that the
Son of Man ... now not only as God, but also as man, knows all things,
can do all things, is present with all creatures.&rdquo; &ldquo;We
reject and condemn the doctrine that he (the Son of God) is not capable
<i>according to his human nature</i> of omnipotence and other
attributes of the divine nature.&rdquo;&mdash;(<span lang=
"de">Concordienb. Summar. Begr. u. Erkl&auml;r. art. 8.</span>)
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Unde et sponte sua fluit, Christo etiam qua
<i>humanam naturam spectato cultum religiosum
deberi</i>.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Buddeus (l. c. l. iv. c. ii. &sect;
17). The same is expressly taught by the Fathers and the Catholics,
<i>e.g.</i>, &ldquo;<span lang="la">Eadem <i>adoratione adoranda</i> in
Christo est divinitas et <i>humanitas</i>.... Divinitas intrinsece
inest humanitati per unionem hypostaticam: ergo <i>humanitas</i>
Christi seu Christus ut <i>homo</i> potest adorari absoluto cultu
latriae.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Theol. Schol. (sec. Thomam Aq. P. Metzger.
iv. p. 124). It is certainly said that it is not man, not flesh and
blood by itself, which is worshipped, but the flesh united with God, so
that the cultus applies not to the flesh, or man, but to God. But it is
here as with the worship of saints and images. As the saint is adored
in the image and God in the saint, only because the image and the saint
are themselves adored, so God is worshipped in the human body only
because the human flesh is itself worshipped. God becomes flesh, man,
because man is in truth already God. How could it enter into thy mind
to bring the human flesh into so close a relation and contact with God
if it were something impure, degrading, unworthy of God? If the value,
the dignity of the human flesh does not lie in itself, why dost thou
not make other flesh&mdash;the flesh of brutes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>the
habitation of the Divine Spirit? True it is said: Man is only the organ
in, with, and by which the Godhead works, as the soul in the body. But
this pretext also is refuted by what has been said above. God chose man
as his organ, his body, because only in man did he find an organ worthy
of him, suitable, pleasing to him. If the nature of man is indifferent,
why did not God become incarnate in a brute? Thus God comes <i>into</i>
man only <i>out of</i> man. The manifestation of God in man is only a
manifestation of the divinity and glory of man. &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Noscitur ex alio, qui non cognoscitur ex
se</span>&rdquo;&mdash;this trivial saying is applicable here. God is
known through man, whom he honours with his personal presence and
indwelling, and known as a human being, for what any one prefers,
selects, loves, in his <i>objective nature</i>; and man is known
through God, and known as a divine being, for only that which is worthy
of God, which is divine, can be the object, organ, and habitation of
God. True it is further said: It is Jesus Christ alone, and no other
man, who is worshipped as God. But this argument also is idle and
empty. Christ is indeed one only, but he is one who represents all. He
is a man as we are, &ldquo;our brother, and we are flesh of his flesh
and bone of his bone.&rdquo; &ldquo;In Jesus Christ our Lord every one
of us is a portion of flesh and blood. Therefore where my body is,
there I believe that I myself reign. Where my flesh is glorified, there
I believe that I am myself glorious. Where my blood rules, there I hold
that I myself rule.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. p. 534). This then is
an undeniable fact: Christians worship the human individual as the
supreme being, as God. Not indeed consciously, for it is the
unconsciousness of this fact which constitutes the illusion of the
religious principle. But in this sense it may be said that the heathens
did not worship the statues of the gods; for to them also the statue
was not a statue, but God himself. Nevertheless they <i>did</i> worship
the statue; just as Christians worship the human individual, though,
naturally, they will not admit it.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Man is the God of Christianity, Anthropology the
mystery of Christian Theology.</i> The history of Christianity has had
for its grand result the unveiling of this mystery&mdash;the
realisation and recognition of theology as anthropology. The
distinction between Protestantism and Catholicism&mdash;the old
Catholicism, which now exists only in books, not in
actuality&mdash;consists only in this, that the latter is Theology, the
former Christology, <i>i.e.</i>, (religious) Anthropology. Catholicism
has a supranaturalistic, abstract God, a God who is other than human, a
not human, a superhuman being. The goal of Catholic morality, likeness
to God, consists therefore in this, to be not a man, but more than a
man&mdash;a heavenly abstract being, an angel. Only in its morality
does the essence of a religion realise, reveal itself: morality alone
is the criterion, whether a religious dogma is felt as a truth or is a
mere chimera. Thus the doctrine of a superhuman, supernatural God is a
truth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>only where it has as its consequence a
superhuman, supernatural, or rather antinatural morality.
Protestantism, on the contrary, has not a supranaturalistic but a human
morality, a morality of and for flesh and blood; consequently its God,
at least its true, real God, is no longer an abstract,
supranaturalistic being, but a being of flesh and blood. &ldquo;This
defiance the devil hears unwillingly, that our flesh and blood is the
Son of God, yea, God himself, and reigns in heaven over
all.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. xvi. p. 573). &ldquo;Out of Christ there
is no God, and where Christ is, there is the whole
Godhead.&rdquo;&mdash;Id. (Th. xix. p. 403). Catholicism has, both in
theory and practice, a God who, in spite of the predicate of love,
exists for himself, to whom therefore man only comes by being against
himself, denying himself, renouncing his existence for self;
Protestantism, on the contrary, has a God who, at least practically,
virtually, has not an existence for himself, but exists only for man,
for the welfare of man. Hence in Catholicism the highest act of the
cultus, &ldquo;the mass of Christ,&rdquo; is a sacrifice of
man,&mdash;the same Christ, the same flesh and blood, is sacrificed to
God in the Host as on the cross; in Protestantism, on the contrary, it
is a sacrifice, a gift of God: God sacrifices himself, surrenders
himself to be partaken by man. (See Luther, <i>e.g.</i>, Th. xx. p.
259; Th. xvii. p. 529.) In Catholicism manhood is the property, the
predicate of the Godhead (of Christ)&mdash;God is man; in
Protestantism, on the contrary, Godhead is the property, the predicate
of manhood (Christ)&mdash;man is God. &ldquo;This, in time past, the
greatest theologians have done&mdash;they have fled from the manhood of
Christ to his Godhead, and attached themselves to that alone, and
thought that we should not know the manhood of Christ. But we must so
rise to the Godhead of Christ, and hold by it in such a way, as not to
forsake the manhood of Christ and come to the Godhead alone. Thou
shouldst know of no God, nor Son of God, save him who was born of the
Virgin Mary and became man. He who receives his manhood has also his
Godhead.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. ix. pp. 592, 598).<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8222src" href="#xd21e8222" name="xd21e8222src">7</a> Or,
briefly thus: in Catholicism, man exists for God; in Protestantism, God
exists for man.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8225src" href="#xd21e8225"
name="xd21e8225src">8</a> &ldquo;Jesus Christ our Lord was conceived
for us, born for us, suffered for us, was crucified, died, and was
buried for us. Our Lord rose from the dead for <i>our</i> consolation,
sits for <i>our</i> good at the right hand of the Almighty Father, and
is to judge the living and the dead for <i>our</i> comfort. This the
holy Apostles and beloved Fathers intended to intimate in their
confession by the words: Us and our Lord&mdash;namely, that Jesus
Christ is ours, whose office and will it is to help us ... so that we
should not read or speak the words coldly, and interpret them only of
Christ, but of ourselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href=
"#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>also.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th.
xvi. p. 538). &ldquo;I know of no God but him who gave himself for me.
Is not that a great thing that God is man, that God gives himself to
man and will be his, as man gives himself to his wife and is hers? But
if God is ours, all things are ours.&rdquo;&mdash;(Th. xii. p. 283.)
&ldquo;God cannot be a God of the dead, who are nothing, but is a God
of the living. If God were a God of the dead, he would be as a husband
who had no wife, or as a father who had no son, or as a master who had
no servant. For if he is a husband, he must have a wife. If he is a
father, he must have a son. If he is a master, he must have a servant.
Or he would be a fictitious father, a fictitious master, that is,
nothing. God is not a God like the idols of the heathens, neither is he
an imaginary God, who exists for himself alone, and has none who call
upon him and worship him. A God is he from whom everything is to be
expected and received.... If he were God for himself alone in heaven,
and we had no good to rely on from him, he would be a God of stone or
straw.... If he sat alone in heaven like a clod, he would not be
God.&rdquo;&mdash;(Th. xvi. p. 465). &ldquo;God says: I the Almighty
Creator of heaven and earth am thy God.... To be a God means to redeem
us from all evil and trouble that oppresses us, as sin, hell, death,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&mdash;(Th. ii. p. 327.) &ldquo;All the world calls that
a God in whom man trusts in need and danger, on whom he relies, from
whom all good is to be had and who can help. Thus reason describes God,
that he affords help to man, and does good to him, bestows benefits
upon him. This thou seest also in this text: &lsquo;I am the Lord thy
God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.&rsquo; There we are
taught what God is, what is his nature, and what are his
attributes,&mdash;namely, that he does good, delivers from dangers, and
helps out of trouble and all calamities.&rdquo;&mdash;(Th. iv. pp. 236,
237.) But if God is a living, <i>i.e.</i>, real God, is God in general,
only in virtue of this&mdash;that he is a God to <i>man</i>, a being
who is useful, good, beneficent to man; then, in truth, man is the
criterion, the measure of God, man is the absolute, divine being. The
proposition: A God existing only for himself is no God&mdash;means
nothing else than that God without man is not God; where there is no
man there is no God; if thou takest from God the predicate of humanity,
thou takest from him the predicate of deity; if his relation to man is
done away with, so also is his existence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Protestantism, at least in theory, has retained in the
background of this human God the old supranaturalistic God.
Protestantism is the contradiction of theory and practice; it has
emancipated the flesh, but not the reason. According to Protestantism,
Christianity, <i>i.e.</i>, God, does not contradict the natural
impulses of man:&mdash;&ldquo;Therefore we ought now to know that God
does not condemn or abolish the natural tendency in man which was
implanted in Nature at the creation, but that he awakens and preserves
it.&rdquo;&mdash;Luther (Th. iii. p. 290). But it contradicts reason,
and is therefore, theoretically, only an object of faith. We have
shown, however, that the nature of faith, the nature of God, is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>itself nothing else than the nature of man
placed out of man, conceived as external to man. The reduction of the
extrahuman, supernatural, and antirational nature of God to the
natural, immanent, inborn nature of man, is therefore the liberation of
Protestantism, of Christianity in general, from its fundamental
contradiction, the reduction of it to its truth,&mdash;the result, the
necessary, irrepressible, irrefragable result of Christianity.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE ENGLISH AND FOREIGN PHILOSOPHICAL LIBRARY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Philosophical Inquiry is essentially the chief
intellectual study of our age. It is proposed to produce, under the
title of &ldquo;<span class="sc">The English and Foreign Philosophical
Library</span>,&rdquo; a series of works of the highest class connected
with that study.</p>
<p>The English contributions to the series consist of original works,
and of occasional new editions of such productions as have already
attained a permanent rank among the philosophical writings of the
day.</p>
<p>Beyond the productions of English writers, there are many recent
publications in German and French which are not readily accessible to
English readers, unless they are competent German and French scholars.
Of these foreign writings, the translations have been entrusted to
gentlemen whose names will be a guarantee for their critical
fidelity.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<span class="sc">The English and
Foreign Philosophical Library</span>&rdquo; claims to be free from all
bias, and thus fairly to represent all developments of Philosophy, from
Spinoza to Hartmann, from Leibnitz to Lotze. Each original work is
produced under the inspection of its author, from his manuscript,
without intermediate suggestions or alterations. As corollaries, works
showing the results of Positive Science, occasionally, though seldom,
find a place in the series.</p>
<p>The series is elegantly printed in octavo, and the price regulated
by the extent of each volume. The volumes will follow in succession, at
no fixed periods, but as early as is consistent with the necessary care
in their production.</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING HAVE ALREADY APPEARED:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The papers translated in
this volume deal with various aspects of a very fascinating study. Herr
Geiger had secured a place in the foremost ranks of German philologers,
but he seems to have valued his philological researches chiefly as a
means of throwing light on the early condition of mankind. He
prosecuted his inquiries in a thoroughly philosophical spirit, and he
never offered a theory, however paradoxical it might seem at first
sight, for which he did not advance solid arguments. Unlike the
majority of German scholars, he took pleasure in working out his
doctrines in a manner that was likely to make them interesting to the
general public; and his capacity for clear and attractive exposition
was hardly inferior to that of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller

<p>LIFE OF GIORDANO BRUNO, THE NOLAN.</p>
<p>By I. FRITH.</p>
<p>Revised by Professor <span class="sc">Moriz Carriere</span>.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The interest of the book
lies in the conception of Bruno&rsquo;s character and in the
elucidation of his philosophy.... His writings dropped from him
wherever he went, and were published in many places. Their number is
very large, and the bibliographical appendix is not the least valuable
part of this volume.... We are tempted to multiply quotations from the
pages before us, for Bruno&rsquo;s utterances have a rare charm through
their directness, their vividness, their poetic force. Bruno stands in
relation to later philosophy, to Kant or Hegel, as Giotto stands to
Raphael. We feel the merit of the more complete and perfect work; but
we are moved and attracted by the greater individuality which
accompanies the struggle after expression in an earlier and simpler
age. Students of philosophy will know at once how much labour has been
bestowed upon this modest attempt to set forth Bruno&rsquo;s
significance as a philosopher. We have contented ourselves with showing
how much the general reader may gain from a study of its pages, which
are never overburdened by technicalities and are never
dull.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>MORAL ORDER AND PROGRESS: AN ANALYSIS OF ETHICAL CONCEPTIONS.</p>
<p>By S. ALEXANDER, Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford.</p>
<p>This work is an account of the factors involved in the two central
phenomena of Order or Equilibrium, and Progress, which are shown to be
essential to morality. Its method is to group ethical facts under the
main working conceptions of morality. It treats Ethics independently of
Biology, but the result is to confirm the theory of Evolution by
showing that the characteristic differences of moral action are such as
should be expected if that theory were true. In particular, Book III.
aims at proving that moral ideals follow, in their origin and
development, the same law as natural species.</p>

<p>With a New Introduction by Professor <span class="sc">W. T.
Harris</span>.</p>
<p>Fichte belongs to those great men whose lives are an everlasting
possession to mankind, and whose words the world does not willingly let
die. His character stands written in his life, a massive but severely
simple whole. It has no parts, the depth and earnestness on which it
rests speak forth alike in his thoughts, words and actions. No man of
his time, few, perhaps, of any time, exercised a more powerful,
spirit-stirring influence over the minds of his fellow-countrymen. The
impulse which he communicated to the national thought extended far
beyond the sphere of his personal influences; it has awakened, it will
still awaken, high emotion and manly resolution in thousands who never
heard his voice. The ceaseless effort of his life was to rouse men to a
sense of the divinity of their own nature, to fix their thoughts upon a
spiritual life as the only true and real life; to teach them to look
upon all else as mere show and unreality; and thus to lead them to
constant effort after the highest ideal of purity, virtue, independence
and self-denial.</p>

<p>LESSING: His Life and Writings.</p>
<p>By JAMES SIME, M.A.</p>
<p>Second Edition.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is to Lessing that an
Englishman would turn with readiest affection. We cannot but wonder
that more of this man is not known amongst
us.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Thomas Carlyle.</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But to Mr. James Sime has been
reserved the honour of presenting to the English public a full-length
portrait of Lessing, in which no portion of the canvas is uncovered,
and in which there is hardly a touch but tells. We can say that a
clearer or more compact piece of biographic criticism has not been
produced in England for many a day.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Westminster
Review.</i></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;An account of Lessing&rsquo;s life
and work on the scale which he deserves is now for the first time
offered to English readers. Mr. Sime has performed his task with
industry, knowledge, and sympathy; qualities which must concur to make
a successful biographer.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This is an admirable book. It
lacks no quality that a biography ought to have. Its method is
excellent, its theme is profoundly interesting: its tone is the
happiest mixture of sympathy and discrimination: its style is clear,
masculine, free from effort or affectation, yet eloquent by its very
sincerity.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He has given a life of Lessing
clear, interesting, and full, while he has given a study of his
writings which bears distinct marks of an intimate acquaintance with
his subject, and of a solid and appreciative
judgment.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>AN ACCOUNT OF THE POLYNESIAN RACE:</p>
<p>ITS ORIGIN AND MIGRATIONS, AND THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE HAWAIIAN
PEOPLE TO THE TIMES OF KAMEHAMEHA I.</p>
<p>By ABRAHAM FORNANDER, Circuit Judge of the Island of Maui, H.I.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mr. Fornander has evidently
enjoyed excellent opportunities for promoting the study which has
produced this work. Unlike most foreign residents in Polynesia he has
acquired a good knowledge of the language spoken by the people among
whom he dwelt. This has enabled him, during his thirty-four
years&rsquo; residence in the Hawaiian Islands, to collect material
which could be obtained only by a person possessing such an advantage.
It is so seldom that a private settler in the Polynesian Islands takes
an intelligent interest in local ethnology and arch&aelig;ology, and
makes use of the advantage he possesses, that we feel especially
thankful to Mr. Fornander for his labours in this comparatively
little-known field of research.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Offers almost portentous evidence
of the acquaintance of the author with the Polynesian customs and
languages, and of his industry and erudite care in the analysis and
comparison of the tongues spoken in the Pacific
Archipelagoes.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>
